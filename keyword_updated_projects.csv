Aleksandr Belakovskiy,"Testosterone Deficiency, Weakness, and Multimorbidity in Men",2018.0,Scientific Reports,Article,"testosterone, multimorbidity men, testosterone deficiency, testosterone tt, weakness multimorbidity, men testosterone, young testosterone, deficiency weakness","2018 The Author(s).The purposes of this study were to evaluate the association between total testosterone (TT) deficiency and weakness on multimorbidity in men. Analyses were performed to examine the prevalence of multimobidity among young, middle-aged, and older men, with and without testosterone deficiency. Multivariate logistic models were also used to determine the association between age-specific TT tertiles and multimorbidity, adjusting for key sociodemographic variables, as well as a secondary analysis adjusted for grip strength. Multimorbidity was more prevalent among men with testosterone deficiency, compared to normal TT in the entire group (36.6% vs 55.2%; p < 0.001); however, differences were only seen within young (testosterone deficiency: 36.4%; normal TT: 13.5%; p < 0.001) and older men (testosterone deficiency: 75.0%; normal TT: 61.5%; p < 0.001). Robust associations were found between the age-specific low-TT (OR: 2.87; 95%CI: 2.14-3.83) and moderate-TT (OR: 1.67; 95%CI: 1.27-2.20) tertiles (reference high-TT) and multimorbidity. Secondary analysis demonstrated that both low TT (OR: 1.82; 95%CI: 1.29-2.55) and moderate-TT (OR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.01-1.69) were associated with multimorbidity, even after adjusting for obesity (OR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.07-2.87) and NGS (OR: 1.21 per 0.05 unit lower NGS). Low TT and weakness in men were independently associated with multimorbidity at all ages; however, multimorbidity was more prevalent among young and older men with testosterone deficiency.",10.1038/s41598-018-24347-6,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-4364-993X,57201633519.0,
Aleksandr Belakovskiy,Testosterone Replacement Therapy for Male Hypogonadism,2024.0,American Family Physician,Article,"testosterone, physicians testosterone, hypogonadism, testosterone deficiency, testosterone replacement, receiving testosterone, therapy male, serum testosterone, male hypogonadism","Copyright © 2024 American Academy of Family Physicians.Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome that can be defined as persistently low serum testosterone levels in the setting of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-4364-993X,57201633519.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recruitment of underrepresented minorities (URM) in medicine has risen to the forefront as a strategy to address health inequities, but the experiences of URM residents within their own programs are poorly understood. We describe the development and implementation of a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) climate survey at our residency program, the results of which have informed our DEI efforts. METHODS: A resident-faculty work group collaboratively developed an 81-item questionnaire, informed by other institutional climate surveys. We administered the survey annually from 2018 through 2021 to all residents and faculty at our large academic family medicine residency program. The anonymous survey covered six key areas: general climate, climate for specific group, personal experience with discrimination and harassment, recruitment, burnout, and curriculum. RESULTS: Average response rates were 84% and 50% for residents and faculty, respectively. Survey results show low satisfaction with resident and faculty diversity; higher rates of burnout for respondents who self-identify as URM, persons of color (POC), and/or LGBTQ; and racial and gender differences in experiences of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,0009-0002-1116-955X,55939874100.0,

All rights reserved.Background: The initiation and timely completion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in young women is critical. We compared the initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among women in 2 community-based networks with electronic health records: 1 with a prompt and reminder system (prompted cohort) and 1 without (unprompted cohort). Methods: Female patients aged 9 to 26 years seen between March 1, 2007, and January 25, 2010, were used as the retrospective cohort. Patient demographics and vaccination dates were extracted from the electronic health records. Results: Patients eligible for the vaccine included 6019 from the prompted cohort and 9096 from the unprompted cohort. Mean age at initiation was 17.3 years in the prompted cohort and 18.1 years in the unprompted cohort. Significantly more (P <.001) patients initiated the vaccine in the prompted cohort (34.9%) compared with the unprompted cohort (21.5%). African Americans aged 9 to 18 years with ≥3 visits during the observation period were significantly more likely to initiate in the prompted cohort (P <.001). The prompted cohort was significantly more likely (P <.001) to complete the vaccine series in a timely manner compared with the unprompted cohort. Conclusion: More patients aged 9 to 26 years initiated and achieved timely completion of the HPV vaccine series in clinics using an electronic health record system with prompts compared with clinics without prompts.",10.3122/jabfm.2015.03.140082,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0009-0002-1116-955X,55939874100.0,

Risk factors include family history, smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity, diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol use, and possible dietary factors. Because more than two-thirds of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas, abdominal pain, jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, and acholic stools may be presenting symptoms. In symptomatic patients, the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to predict prognosis and recurrence after resection. Pancreas protocol computed tomography is considered standard for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Although surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, less than 20% of surgical candidates survive five years. The decision on resectability requires multidisciplinary consultation. Pancreatic resections should be performed at institutions that complete at least 15 of the surgeries annually. Postoperatively, use of gemcitabine or fluorouracil/leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival by several months. However, more than 80% of patients present with disease that is not surgically resectable. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine or irinotecan provides clinical benefit and modest survival improvement. Palliation should address pain control, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction, malnutrition, thromboembolic disease, and depression. © 2014 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Sidney Kimmel Medical College,0000-0001-8336-478X,55939874100.0,

Methods: Audits of 833 cytology request forms for low-risk women completing a Papanicolaou smear, from January 2008 to April 2011, from 5 Michigan family medicine clinics determined HPV orders completed by the clinician performing the Papanicolaou smear. Multivariate logistic regression models examined differences in HPV test ordering by patient age at Papanicolaou test, provider status and sex, and clinic across sites. A Poisson regression model analyzed the annual number of HPV test orders over time. Results: Cytology requests were completed by 622 faculty (75%), 169 residents/fellows (20%), and 42 nurse practitioner/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). HPV testing for any cytology result was ordered on 324 request forms (39%) by residents/fellows (48%), faculty (38%), and NP/PAs (10%). Female providers were twice as likely as men to order HPV testing for any cytology result across all clinics and provider statuses (P < .001). There were significant differences in HPV test ordering among clinics. Between 2008 and 2011 annual cytology requests increased 46%, including HPV testing for any cytology result after adjusting for faculty provider sex. Conclusion: HPV test ordering when cytology is collected varied by clinic and provider status and sex. HPV co-testing for any cytology result remains modest, but is increasing over time in these clinics.",10.3122/jabfm.2013.06.120260,Sidney Kimmel Medical College,0000-0001-8336-478X,55939874100.0,

It has been recognized as a rare outcome of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted infection. Persistent infection with high-risk oncogenic HPV types is a known cause of cervical cancer. The benefits of cytological screening for cervical cancer are well known. However, the necessary resources, infrastructure and technological expertise, together with the need for repeated screening at regular intervals, make cytological screening resource intense. HPV DNA testing is a viable alternative to cytological screening. With optimal testing systems, HPV DNA can be identified in nearly all specimens of invasive cervical cancer and in the vast majority (>95%) of the immediate cervical cancer precursors, namely high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). HPV DNA testing has been shown to decrease cervical cancer mortality. In this chapter, the clinical utility of HPV DNA testing for cervical cancer will be reviewed with a focus on primary screening, combination with cytology (co-testing), triage for abnormal cytology, and post-treatment surveillance. The review focuses on cost and patient outcomes in a wide variety of resource settings, contrasting HPV testing to other screening strategies. Technology exists today, which could eradicate death from cervical cancer. It is time to act. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In many situations, however, the standard models do not adequately represent the failure mechanism in a real operational setting. In the test-fix-retest setting of observing the failure process of a system, we propose a stochastic model of RG from the consideration of inherent and assignable failure causes. Essentially, this model can be viewed as a two-component series system, where one component pertains to reliability growth following an intervention while the life distribution of the other does not change from one stage to another. For the component exhibiting growth in reliability, a parametric step-intensity structure is assumed which provides a stochastic basis for the Duane plot. Exact and large sample properties of the estimates of the model parameters based on maximum likelihood and nonlinear least squares are investigated. Certain irregularities and pathologies shared by the estimates are pointed out. Extensive simulation study has been carried out and the numerical findings are provided as a supplement to the theoretical results.",10.1201/9781003418313_16,Oakland University,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Adults with a triple multimorbidity (hypertension, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, and overweight or obesity), are at increased risk of serious health complications, but experts disagree on which dietary patterns and support strategies should be recommended. METHODS We randomized 94 adults from southeast Michigan with this triple multimorbidity using a 2 × 2 diet-by-support factorial design, comparing a very low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet vs a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, as well as comparing results with and without multicomponent extra support (mindful eating, positive emotion regulation, social support, and cooking). RESULTS Using intention-to-treat analyses, compared with the DASH diet, the VLC diet led to greater improvement in estimated mean systolic blood pressure (–9.77 mm Hg vs –5.18 mm Hg; P =.046), greater improvement in glycated hemoglobin (–0.35% vs –0.14%; P =.034), and greater improvement in weight (–19.14 lb vs –10.34 lb; P =.0003). The addition of extra support did not have a statistically significant effect on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS For adults with hypertension, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, and overweight or obesity, the VLC diet resulted in greater improvements in systolic blood pressure, glycemic control, and weight over a 4-month period compared with the DASH diet. These findings suggest that larger trials with longer follow-up are warranted to determine whether the VLC diet might be more beneficial for disease management than the DASH diet for these high-risk adults.",10.1370/afm.2968,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

Despite clinical practice guideline recommendations, effective pharmacotherapy, and interventions to support patients and providers, up to 60% of patients diagnosed with T2DM are estimated to have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels above the recommended targets owing to multilevel barriers hindering optimal glycemic control. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare changes in HbA1c levels among patients with suboptimally controlled T2DM who were offered the opportunity to use an intermittently viewed continuous glucose monitor and receive personalized low-carbohydrate nutrition counseling (<100 g/day) versus those who received usual care (UC). Methods: This was a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized quality improvement program. All adult patients with T2DM who received primary care at a university-affiliated primary care clinic (N=1584) were randomized to either the UC or the enhanced care (EC) group. Within each program arm, we identified individuals with HbA1c >7.5% (58 mmol/mol) who were medically eligible for tighter glycemic control, and we defined these subgroups as UC–high risk (UC-HR) or EC-HR. UC-HR participants (n=197) received routine primary care. EC-HR participants (n=185) were invited to use an intermittently viewed continuous glucose monitor and receive low-carbohydrate nutrition counseling. The primary outcome was mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 12 months using an intention-to-treat difference-in-differences analysis comparing EC-HR with UC-HR groups. We conducted follow-up semistructured interviews to understand EC-HR participant experiences with the intervention. Results: HbA1c decreased by 0.41% (4.5 mmol/mol; P=.04) more from baseline to 12 months among participants in the EC-HR group than among those in UC-HR; however, only 61 (32.9%) of 185 EC-HR participants engaged in the program. Among the EC-HR participants who wore continuous glucose monitors (61/185, 32.9%), HbA1c was 1.1% lower at 12 months compared with baseline (P<.001). Interviews revealed themes related to EC-HR participants’ program engagement and continuous glucose monitor use. Conclusions: Among patients with suboptimally controlled T2DM, a combined approach that includes continuous glucose monitoring and low-carbohydrate nutrition counseling can improve glycemic control compared with the standard of care.",10.2196/31184,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

Using PERMANOVA models, we assessed factors associated with vaginal community structure in pregnancy, examined whether host factors were conserved across populations, and tested the independent and combined effects of host factors on vaginal community state types (CSTs) using multinomial logistic regression models. Demographic and social factors explained a larger amount of variation in the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy than clinical factors. After adjustment, lower education, rather than self-identified race, remained a robust predictor of L. iners dominant (CST III) and diverse (CST IV) (OR = 8.44, 95% CI = 4.06–17.6 and OR = 4.18, 95% CI = 1.88–9.26, respectively). In random forest models, we identified specific taxonomic features of host factors, particularly urogenital pathogens associated with pregnancy complications (Aerococcus christensenii and Gardnerella spp.) among other facultative anaerobes and key markers of community instability (L. iners). Sociodemographic factors were robustly associated with vaginal microbiota structure in pregnancy and should be considered as sources of variation in human microbiome studies.",10.1038/s41598-024-62537-7,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,
Ananda Sen,Identifying genes associated with disease outcomes using joint sparse canonical correlation analysis—An application in renal clear cell carcinoma,2024.0,Genetic Epidemiology,Article,interaction; pathway; sparse caonical correlation; interaction; pathway; sparse caonical correlation,"2024 The Authors. Genetic Epidemiology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Somatic changes like copy number aberrations (CNAs) and epigenetic alterations like methylation have pivotal effects on disease outcomes and prognosis in cancer, by regulating gene expressions, that drive critical biological processes. To identify potential biomarkers and molecular targets and understand how they impact disease outcomes, it is important to identify key groups of CNAs, the associated methylation, and the gene expressions they impact, through a joint integrative analysis. Here, we propose a novel analysis pipeline, the joint sparse canonical correlation analysis (jsCCA), an extension of sCCA, to effectively identify an ensemble of CNAs, methylation sites and gene (expression) components in the context of disease endpoints, especially tumor characteristics. Our approach detects potentially orthogonal gene components that are highly correlated with sets of methylation sites which in turn are correlated with sets of CNA sites. It then identifies the genes within these components that are associated with the outcome. Further, we aggregate the effect of each gene expression set on tumor stage by constructing “gene component scores” and test its interaction with traditional risk factors. Analyzing clinical and genomic data on 515 renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients from the TCGA-KIRC, we found eight gene components to be associated with methylation sites, regulated by groups of proximally located CNA sites. Association analysis with tumor stage at diagnosis identified a novel association of expression of ASAH1 gene trans-regulated by methylation of several genes including SIX5 and by CNAs in the 10q25 region including TCF7L2. Further analysis to quantify the overall effect of gene sets on tumor stage, revealed that two of the eight gene components have significant interaction with smoking in relation to tumor stage. These gene components represent distinct biological functions including immune function, inflammatory responses, and hypoxia-regulated pathways. Our findings suggest that jsCCA analysis can identify interpretable and important genes, regulatory structures, and clinically consequential pathways. Such methods are warranted for comprehensive analysis of multimodal data especially in cancer genomics.",10.1002/gepi.22566,National Cancer Institute (NCI),0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,
Ananda Sen,Learning Obstetrical Cervical Exam Skills: Development of a Novel Model to Demystify Blind Procedures,2023.0,Family Medicine,Article,"cervical exam, cervical examination, learning obstetrical, teach cervical, blind procedures, sterile cervical, cervical, obstetrical cervical, vaginal exam","Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.Background and Objectives: Obstetric care is a core element in family medicine education. New interns typically learn the sterile cervical exam on the job by examining women in labor. This can be uncomfortable for patients and may increase the risk of infection. Simulated training could minimize these challenges, but manufactured models are expensive and not widely available in residency programs. We sought to evaluate a simple, homemade sewn model using stretchy fabric and pipe cleaners that could improve teaching and acquisition of cervical examination skills and common obstetrical procedures. Methods: We used the model to teach cervical examination skills to students and new interns and assessed participant satisfaction. We evaluated examination accuracy by grading practice exams on the model before and after a workshop teaching obstetrical procedures including the sterile vaginal exam. We calculated satisfaction using summary statistics. We evaluated pre-and postscores for exam accuracy using paired t tests. Results: Interns demonstrated a significant improvement in cervical exam skills using the model, and participants reported very high satisfaction with the workshop utilizing the model. Conclusions: We developed a simple, low-cost cervical exam model that was shown to be well-regarded by trainees and could be duplicated by other residency programs. This approach provides a unique and accessible way to offer hands-on simulation during obstetrical training. The model may improve trainees’ understanding of the procedures which would lead to better experiences for obstetrical patients.",10.22454/FamMed.55.284433,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

This study sought to update data on physician suicides in the United States. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) at the Centers for Disease Control collects details about violent deaths. The study used 2010–2015 data from 27 NVDRS states to identify suicide deaths among physicians or non-physicians and calculate annual standardized mortality rates (SMR). Of 63,780 victims total, there were 357 physicians identified over 6 years, (307 men and 50 women). If results are extrapolated to all 50 states, there would be approximately 119 physician suicides annually. The SMR for physicians overall was not statistically different from that of non-physicians. This is the first study in 16 years to update estimated physician suicide rates in the United States. The research used strict criteria to identify physicians so results likely represent the lower boundary of physician suicides. Findings show that physician suicide is not significantly lower than that of non-physicians and emphasizes the importance of focusing on structural changes to reduce stigma around mental health in the medical community.",10.1080/13548506.2021.1903053,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,8359341.0
Ananda Sen,Self-administered acupressure for veterans with chronic back pain: Study design and methodology of a type 1 hybrid effectiveness implementation randomized controlled trial,2023.0,Contemporary Clinical Trials,Article,Acupressure; Chronic musculoskeletal pain; Complementary and integrative health; Veterans; Acupressure; Chronic musculoskeletal pain; Complementary and integrative health; Veterans,"2023Background: Chronic low back pain is prevalent and disabling in Veterans, but effective pain management is challenging. Clinical practice guidelines emphasize multimodal pain management including evidence-based complementary and integrative health treatments such as acupressure as a first line of care. Unfortunately, the ability to replicate interventions, cost, resources, and limited access are implementation barriers. Self-administered acupressure has shown positive effects on pain and can be practiced anywhere with little to no side effects. Methods/design: The aims of this Type 1 hybrid effectiveness implementation randomized controlled trial are 1) to determine effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure protocol at improving pain interference and secondary outcomes of fatigue, sleep quality, and disability in 300 Veterans with chronic low back pain, and 2) evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators to scale-up acupressure utilization within Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Participants randomized to the intervention will receive instruction on acupressure application using an app that facilitates daily practice for 6 weeks. During weeks 6 through 10, participants will discontinue acupressure to determine sustainability of effects. Participants randomized to waitlist control will continue their usual care for pain management and receive study materials at the end of the study period. Outcomes will be collected at baseline and at 6- and 10-weeks post baseline. The primary outcome is pain interference, measured by the PROMIS pain interference scale. Using established frameworks and a mixed methods approach, we will evaluate intervention implementation. Discussion: If acupressure is effective, we will tailor strategies to support implementation in the VHA based on study findings.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Copy number aberrations (CNAs) in cancer affect disease outcomes by regulating molecular phenotypes, such as gene expressions, that drive important biological processes. To gain comprehensive insights into molecular biomarkers for cancer, it is critical to identify key groups of CNAs, the associated gene modules, regulatory modules, and their downstream effect on outcomes. Methods In this paper, we demonstrate an innovative use of sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) to effectively identify the ensemble of CNAs, and gene modules in the context of binary and censored disease endpoints. Our approach detects potentially orthogonal gene expression modules which are highly correlated with sets of CNA and then identifies the genes within these modules that are associated with the outcome. Results Analyzing clinical and genomic data on 1,904 breast cancer patients from the METABRIC study, we found 14 gene modules to be regulated by groups of proximally located CNA sites. We validated this finding using an independent set of 1,077 breast invasive carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our analysis of 7 clinical endpoints identified several novel and interpretable regulatory associations, highlighting the role of CNAs in key biological pathways and processes for breast cancer. Genes significantly associated with the outcomes were enriched for early estrogen response pathway, DNA repair pathways as well as targets of transcription factors such as E2F4, MYC, and ETS1 that have recognized roles in tumor characteristics and survival. Subsequent meta-analysis across the endpoints further identified several genes through the aggregation of weaker associations. Conclusions Our findings suggest that sCCA analysis can aggregate weaker associations to identify interpretable and important genes, modules, and clinically consequential pathways.",10.1371/journal.pone.0276886,National Cancer Institute (NCI),0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

Methods: We randomized 204 low-income primary care patients who had at least moderate depressive symptoms to intervention or control. Intervention participants received 12 months of weekly automated interactive voice response telephone calls that assessed their symptom severity and provided self-management strategies. Their patient-nominated supporter (CarePartner) received corresponding guidance on self-management support, and their primary care team received urgent notifications. Those randomized to enhanced usual care received printed generic self-management instructions. Results: One-year attrition rate was 14%. By month 6, symptom severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) decreased 2.5 points more in the intervention arm than in the control arm (95% CI -4.2 to -0.8, p = 0.003). This benefit was similar at month 12 (p = 0.004). Intervention was also over twice as likely to lead to =50% reduction in symptom severity by month 6 (OR = 2.2 (1.1, 4.7)) and a decrease of =5 PHQ-9 points by month 12 (OR = 2.3 (1.2, 4.4)). Conclusions: Technology-facilitated self-management guidance with lay support and clinician notifications improves depression for primary care patients.

All rights reserved.Background: Individuals with hearing loss (HL) are at higher risk for hospitalizations, and may be for readmissions, compared with their hearing peers. The objective of this prospective study was to confirm retrospective studies suggesting that HL increases hospital readmissions, and, if confirmed, possible causes for it. Methods: A prospective cohort study of English-speaking patients >55 years old admitted to general medical and surgical floors at 2 large hospital systems in southeastern Michigan over a 2-year period was conducted. All patients underwent bedside audiometric testing. HL presence and severity were categorized using World Health Organization pure tone assessment parameters. Readmission rates, Charlson comorbidity index, socio-demographic and medical variables were obtained from Epic EMR databases. Outcomes: There were 1247 hospitalized patients enrolled. Of these, 76.8% had documented HL of which 50.5% (630) was mild HL and 26.3% (328) moderate or worse HL. Patients with any HL were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic, white, male, and had less education, lower health literacy, more comorbidities, and more difficulty communicating with their doctor. Readmission rates at 30 and 90-days were similar between HL and hearing groups, after adjusting for HL severity, Charlston index, and numerous potential confounders. Conclusion: Patients with HL do not seem to have higher rates of hospital readmissions. We did find high frequency of HL in hospitalized patients along with significant communication difficulties that patients had with their clinicians.

Methods: Leveraging a national ESKD patient claims database administered by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we conducted a retrospective cohort study that characterized the effects of in-hospital COVID-19 on all-cause unplanned readmission and death within 30 days of discharge for patients on dialysis. Included in this study were 436,745 live acute-care hospital discharges of 222,154 Medicare beneficiaries on dialysis from 7871 Medicare-certified dialysis facilities between January 1 and October 31, 2020. Adjusting for patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and prevalent comorbidities, we fit facility-stratified Cox cause-specific hazard models with two interval-specific (1-7 and 8-30 days after hospital discharge) effects of in-hospital COVID-19 and effects of prehospitalization COVID-19. Results: The hazard ratios due to in-hospital COVID-19 over the first 7 days after discharge were 95% CI, 1.53 to 1.65 for readmission and 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.70 for death, both with P<0.001. For the remaining 23 days, the hazard ratios were 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.96 and 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.07, with P<0.001 and P=0.50, respectively. Effects of prehospitalization COVID-19 were mostly nonsignificant. Conclusions: In-hospital COVID-19 had an adverse effect on both postdischarge readmission and death over the first week. With the surviving patients having COVID-19 substantially selected from those hospitalized, in-hospital COVID-19 was associated with lower rates of readmission and death starting from the second week.",10.34067/KID.0000242022,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction: Often misperceived as solely a dental disease, periodontitis is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the support structures of the tooth and associated with chronic systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Despite affecting almost 40% of US adults 30 years of age or older, periodontitis is rarely considered when quantifying the multimorbidity (the presence of 2 or more chronic conditions in an individual) burden for our patients. Multimorbidity represents a major challenge for primary care and is associated with increasing health care expenditure and increased hospitalizations. We hypothesized that periodontitis was associated with multimorbidity. Methods: To interrogate our hypothesis, we performed a secondary data analysis of a population-based cross-sectional survey, the NHANES 2011 to 2014 dataset. The study population included US adults aged 30 years or older who underwent a periodontal examination. Prevalence of periodontitis in individuals with and without multimorbidity was calculated using likelihood estimates and adjusting for confounding variables with logistic regression models. Results: Individuals with multimorbidity were more likely than the general population and individuals without multimorbidity to have periodontitis. However, in adjusted analyses, there was no independent association between periodontitis and multimorbidity. Given the absence of an association, we included periodontitis as a qualifying condition for the diagnosis of multimorbidity. As a result, the prevalence of multimorbidity in US adults 30 years and older increased from 54.1% to 65.8%. Discussion: Periodontitis is a highly prevalent, preventable chronic inflammatory condition. It shares many common risk factors with multimorbidity but was not independently associated with multimorbidity in our study. Further research is required to understand these observations and whether treating periodontitis in patients with multimorbidity may improve health care outcomes.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.220207R1,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9632-6704,55443624400.0,

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + .

An effective and practical means of decreasing unintended second adolescent pregnancies needs to be identified. The objective of this study is to determine if early initiation of contraception, and in particular long acting reversible contraception (LARC), decreases rapid repeat pregnancy among first time adolescent mothers. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Urban teaching hospital. Participants: 340 first-time adolescent mothers age ≤19. Interventions: None, study was retrospective. Main Outcome Measures: Repeat pregnancy within 2 years. Results: 340 first time adolescent mothers with a documented follow-up time of 2 years had a repeat pregnancy rate of 35%. Average time from delivery to repeat pregnancy was 9.9 ± 6.4 months. Logistic regression analysis comparing adolescents with and without repeat pregnancy revealed that leaving the hospital postpartum without initiating any contraception was associated with significant increase risk of repeat pregnancy (OR = 2.447, 95% CI 1.326-4.515). Follow-up within 8 weeks postpartum was associated with lower chance of repeat pregnancy (OR = 0.322, 95% CI 0.172-0.603). Initiation of a LARC method (either an intrauterine device or etonogestrel subdermal implant) by 8 weeks postpartum was also associated with decreased chance of rapid repeat pregnancy (OR = 0.118, 95% CI 0.035-0.397). Conclusion: Adolescent mothers who initiate a LARC method within 8 weeks of delivery are less likely to have a repeat pregnancy within 2 years than those who choose other methods or no method. First time adolescent mothers should be counseled about this advantage of using LARC.",10.1016/j.jpag.2014.04.005,Washington Hospital Center,0000-0002-9500-6282,56472463000.0,

During the visit, the physician should address patient and parent/caregiver concerns and ask about emergency department or hospital care since the last visit; lifestyle habits (diet, physical activity, daily screen time, secondhand smoke exposure, hours of sleep per night, dental care, safety habits); and school performance. Poor school performance may indicate problems such as learning disabilities, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or bullying. Previsit questionnaires and psychosocial screening questionnaires are also useful. When performing a physical examination, the physician should be alert for signs of abuse. Children should be screened for obesity (defined as body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex), and obese children should be referred for intensive behavioral interventions. Although its recommendations are primarily based on expert opinion, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for hypertension annually, vision and hearing problems approximately every two years, and dyslipidemia once between nine and 11 years of age; regular screening for risk factors related to social determinants of health is also recommended. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for depression before 12 years of age, but depression should be considered in children younger than 12 years presenting with unexplained somatic symptoms, restlessness, separation anxiety, phobias, or hallucinations. Children living in areas with inadequate levels of fluoride in the water supply (0.6 ppm or less) should receive daily fluoride supplements.

Mutations in RYR1 are associated with several congenital myopathies (termed RYR1-related myopathies) that are the most common non-dystrophic muscle diseases of childhood. Currently, no treatments exist for these disorders. Although the primary pathogenic abnormality involves defective excitation-contraction coupling, other abnormalities likely play a role in disease pathogenesis. In an effort to discover novel pathogenic mechanisms, we analysed two complementary models of RYR1-related myopathies, the relatively relaxed zebrafish and cultured myotubes from patients with RYR1-related myopathies. Expression array analysis in the zebrafish disclosed significant abnormalities in pathways associated with cellular stress. Subsequent studies focused on oxidative stress in relatively relaxed zebrafish and RYR1-related myopathy myotubes and demonstrated increased oxidant activity, the presence of oxidative stress markers, excessive production of oxidants by mitochondria and diminished survival under oxidant conditions. Exposure to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced oxidative stress and improved survival in the RYR1-related myopathies human myotubes ex vivo and led to significant restoration of aspects of muscle function in the relatively relaxed zebrafish, thereby confirming its efficacy in vivo. We conclude that oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological mechanism in RYR1-related myopathies and that N-acetylcysteine is a successful treatment modality ex vivo and in a vertebrate disease model. We propose that N-acetylcysteine represents the first potential therapeutic strategy for these debilitating muscle diseases. © 2012 The Author.",10.1093/brain/aws036,Michigan Medicine,0000-0002-9500-6282,56472463000.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support the provision of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the contraceptive implant to women immediately after childbirth. We aimed to assess perceived training needs and barriers to immediate postpartum contraceptive service delivery among US family physicians. METHODS: We contributed items regarding postpartum contraception to the 2015 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) omnibus survey of a national cohort of family medicine educators. We assessed self-estimated adequacy of training to insert IUDs and implants immediately postpartum, how often these services are provided, and barriers to service provision RESULTS: Our sample of 409 respondents who provide labor and delivery maternity care was primarily Caucasian (79.9%) and female (56.0%). Significantly fewer respondents felt comfortable counseling about long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), inserting an IUD, and inserting an implant immediately postpartum compared to at 6+ weeks postpartum (all comparisons P<0.001). Fewer respondents felt adequately trained to insert an immediate postpartum IUD (36.4%) than an implant (58.7%; P<0.001). Most respondents had never placed an immediate postpartum IUD (81.17%) or implant (80.1%). Device unavailability was the most commonly cited reason for never having placed an immediate postpartum IUD (67.8%) or implant (71.2%) at one’s institution. CONCLUSIONS: As reimbursement for immediate postpartum contraception becomes more common, family physicians are on the front lines to make these services available to patients who desire them.

We describe the implementation of an ""expanded medical home"" partnering a primary care practice (the Ypsilanti Health Center [YHC]) with local school-based health centers (the Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools [RAHS]), and to assess whether this model improves access to and quality of care for shared patients. Methods: Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we define the steps in, barriers to, and facilitating factors in implementing the expanded medical home model. Visits and quality measures were assessed for patients seen by YHC only versus YHC/RAHS at baseline and during the intervention. Results: At baseline, patients seen at YHC/RAHS had higher compliance with most quality metrics compared with those seen at YHC only. The proportion of shared patients significantly increased because of the intervention (P ≤ .001). Overall, patients seen in the expanded medical home had a higher likelihood of receiving quality metric services than patients in YHC only (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-2.05) across all measures. Conclusions: Thoughtful and intentional implementation of an expanded medical home partnership between primary care physicians and school-based health centers increases the number of shared highrisk adolescent patients.

The Brief Inpatient Screen was designed to assess recent emotional, physical, and sexual abuse in a general inpatient medical-surgical setting and compared to the Composite Abuse Scale. Methods: Researchers matched ""cases"" (inpatients screening Brief Inpatient Screen-positive) to up to four ""controls"" (inpatients screening Brief Inpatient Screen-negative). Forty-six female hospital inpatients ages 18-64 years completed a self-administered survey. The sensitivity and specificity of the Brief Inpatient Screen and its subscales were compared to the Composite Abuse Scale. Researchers examined the performance of the Brief Inpatient Screen when used as a verbal screen versus an anonymous written screen. Results: Twelve of 46 participants (26%) had a positive screen. Compared to the Composite Abuse Scale, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the verbal Brief Inpatient Screen were 52.6% (95% CI 28.9-75.6) and 92.6% (95% CI 75.7-99.1), respectively. The written Brief Inpatient Screen showed improved sensitivity overall (68.4%, 95% CI 43.5-87.4) for the most severe intimate partner violence. Subscale analysis revealed greater sensitivity for emotional and severe combined intimate partner violence. Conclusions: The verbal Brief Inpatient Screen, when compared to the Composite Abuse Scale, was limited in its ability to identify intimate partner violence. An anonymous written format improved sensitivity. Future research should optimize intimate partner violence screening among inpatients. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/03630242.2012.724763,Michigan Medicine,0009-0008-7501-6441,55391342500.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With the emergence of COVID-19, tele-medicine use has increased dramatically as clinicians and patients have looked for alternatives to face-to-face care. Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout. There was a high level of satisfaction at our institution despite multiple technical challenges.",10.22454/FamMed.2021.613099,University of Michigan Medical School,0009-0008-7501-6441,55391342500.0,

From family physicians’ perspectives, this shift to virtual care has the potential to affect workflow, job satisfaction, and patient communication. As clinics reopened and care delivery models shifted to a combination of in-person and virtual care, the need to understand physician experiences with virtual care arose in order to improve both patient and provider experiences. This study investigated Michigan Medicine family medicine physicians’ perceptions of virtual care through qualitative interviews to better understand how to improve the quality and effectiveness of virtual care for both patients and physicians. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive design to examine physician perspectives through semistructured interviews. We coded and analyzed transcripts using thematic analysis, facilitated by MAXQDA (VERBI) software. Results: The results of the analysis identified four major themes: (a) chief concerns that are appropriate for virtual evaluation, (b) physician perceptions of patient benefits, (c) focused but contextually enriched patient-physician communication, and (d) structural support needed for high-quality virtual care. Conclusions: These findings can help further direct the discussion of how to make use of resources to improve the quality and effectiveness of virtual care.",10.22454/FamMed.2024.592756,University of Michigan Medical School,0009-0008-7501-6441,55391342500.0,

The classic definition of menorrhagia (i.e., greater than 80 mL of blood loss per cycle) is rarely used clinically. Women describe the loss or reduction of daily activities as more important than the actual volume of bleeding. Routine testing of all women with menorrhagia for inherited coagulation disorders is unnecessary. Saline infusion sonohysteroscopy detects intracavitary abnormalities such as endometrial polyps or uterine leiomyoma and is less expensive and invasive than hysteroscopy. Endometrial biopsy is effective for diagnosing precancerous lesions and adenocarcinoma but not for intracavitary lesions. Except for continuous progestin, medical therapies are limited. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is an effective therapy for women who want to preserve fertility and avoid surgery. Surgical therapies include endometrial ablation methods that preserve the uterus; and hysterectomy, which results in high satisfaction rates but with potential surgical morbidity. Overall, hysterectomy and endometrial ablation result in the greatest satisfaction rates if future childbearing is not desired. Treatment of menorrhagia results in substantial improvement in quality of life. Copyright © 2007 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Michigan Medicine,,16643340300.0,

The 2006 guidelines include recommendations for special populations (i.e., adolescents and pregnant women). Human papillomavirus testing is now included for management of atypical glandular cytology, for follow-up after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and in combination with cytologic screening in women 30 years and older. The preferred management of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance in adult women is reflex human papillomavirus DNA testing. Colposcopy is recommended for adult women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical glandular cells, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 can be managed conservatively in adult women, but treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grades 2 and 3 is recommended. Immediate treatment is an option for adult women but not for adolescents with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Conservative management of adolescents with any cytologic or histologic diagnosis except specified cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ is recommended. Colposcopy is preferred for pregnant women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, but evaluation of the former may be deferred until no earlier than six weeks postpartum.

Although the federal government, academic institutions and the private sector now offer more opportunities for education and research on H/DS, greater support in real time is needed to facilitate providers during the clinical encounter. Objective: This small, pilot study evaluates the effects of implementation of smart phrases in the electronic health record (EHR) and an educational intervention on providers’ knowledge, attitude and use of H/DS in the clinical encounter. Design, Setting and Participants: The study was conducted at The Institute for Family Health (IFH), a Federally Qualified Health Center and academic health center which operates the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health in affiliation with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Baseline and post-intervention surveys were conducted to explore providers’ attitudes, knowledge and use of integrative medicine (IM) smart phrases on H/DS. Main Outcome Measures: Providers’ awareness of smart phrases of H/DS, knowledge of the content, confidence in using smart phrases to discuss H/DS, self-reported use of smart phrases were measured. Results: A total of 32 subjects participated in the intervention and completed the baseline survey.

Older adults, especially those who are nearing the end of life, are already at higher risk of the detrimental effects of social isolation and loneliness. Novel social distancing rules imposed by governments and agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused older adults to experience a degree of social isolation and loneliness that is unprecedented. This article highlights aspects of the social isolation and loneliness literature. Three cases of elderly patients who required medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Common themes of factors contributing to social isolation in each of the health care delivery settings are described, and opportunities for creative interventions by health care providers are identified. As the pandemic continues to unfold and evolve, providers should aim to regularly assess patient risk of isolation and be proactive in preventing negative effects.

Despite this fact, however, the nursing profession has faced challenges recognizing the full potential of these concepts. While their importance is documented and acknowledged, they are not clearly evident or easily recognized within the nursing profession. In fact, there are many barriers to the integration of these concepts. We identify and address two barriers to addressing health disparities and increasing diversity: disconnects and discrimination. Furthermore, we discuss three factors-dissemination, durability, and data-that may facilitate nursing's efforts to integrate the 3Ds into the profession. Five pivotal models that address these barriers and facilitators are presented as exemplars that have the potential to guide efforts to address diversity, disparities, and social determinants of health and act as catalysts for change within the nursing profession. © 2014 Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.",10.1177/00333549141291s208,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0003-3715-4436,13604642900.0,

Nursing's philosophy of holistic care, which aims to improve the quality of life of patients and families, aligns with the primary objective of PC, positioning nurses to take the lead in expanding and improving PC delivery to all patients with a life-threatening diagnosis. The best way to facilitate this level of care is when staff nurses and advanced practice nurses work collaboratively. Aim: To establish a new standard for nursing education that emphasises intradisciplinary care. Methods: To fill the gap in PC education for nursing students, a dedicated elective PC class was developed for undergraduate and graduate students at a large midwestern University in the United States. Findings: Through an interactive approach to learning, both groups were able to experience and more fully understand how they would work collaboratively with each other to provide high-quality PC.

All rights reserved.Background: Palliative care (PC) focuses on listening to patient preferences, goals, and values to help health care providers educate, support, and collaborate during challenging disease processes, demanding treatments, and difficult decision-making. Method: A recently developed Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness helps guide nursing students in initiating therapeutic conversations about PC. Each phase and transition shows unique characteristics of illness and treatment to clarify the importance of introducing PC for that phase. Interventions in education, support, and treatment help students guide patients and families through the trajectory of serious illness. Results: The Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness and PC interventions provide a clear and practical structure to educate and empower nursing students to engage in PC conversations. Conclusion: Nursing educators can integrate this new model to broaden the perspective of PC as an everyday nursing practice for patients who have a serious illness.",10.3928/01484834-240230306-05,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0003-3715-4436,13604642900.0,

The aim of this exploratory study was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nursing care delivery, the empathetic response of nurses to their patients and family members, and the emotional and physical well-being of the nurses. Four frontline nurses were interviewed while in the midst of the pandemic. Common themes emerged from analysis of the nurses' narratives and included changes in role, increased workload, depersonalized and mechanical care delivery, communication challenges with patient and family members, deficits in palliative care education, perceived poor administrative support, and physical/emotional exhaustion. Clinical leaders and nursing staff have opportunities to engage in supportive endeavors, which can restore focus and regain positive perceptions, strengthen coping skills, and deliver palliative care education in response to the ongoing challenges and stressors created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Information gathered included demographics, use of prescription medications, use of vitamin and herbal supplements, the reasons for using these supplements, perceived benefits of these products, where the information regarding them was gathered, and with whom patients had discussed their use. • RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of patients reported nearly daily use of vitamins. Multivitamins were the most common vitamin and were used by 46% of the patients. Eight percent of patients used herbal products on a daily basis. Twenty-six percent learned about vitamins from their primary care physician (PCP), and just 2% from their ophthalmologists, while 35% discussed their actual use with a PCP, and 5% with their ophthalmologists. Just 2% of these patients learned of herbs from a PCP, and <1% from an ophthalmologist. Older patients used multivitamins and other vitamins most frequently, while gender and education were not predictive of vitamin or herbal use. Mean monthly spending on vitamins by users was $15.74, while herbal users spent a monthly mean of $15.35. • CONCLUSIONS: Vitamins and herbs are used by a significant number of patients in a comprehensive ophthalmology setting. Given the prevalence of vitamin and herbal use, ophthalmologists should systematically inquire about their use. © 2005 by Elsevier Inc.

Team-based care can optimize outcomes. IMPACT the Brain is a care coordination program that aims to improve access to team-based care for patients with MBC and CNS metastases.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Patients with MBC and CNS metastases were eligible for enrollment in this care coordination program. A team of specialists supported a dedicated program coordinator who provided navigation, education, specialty referral, and clinical trial screening. A unique intake form developed for the program created personalized, coordinated, and expedited specialty referrals. Patient-reported outcomes and caregiver burden assessments were collected on a voluntary basis throughout enrollment. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.RESULTS:Sixty patients were referred, and 53 were enrolled (88%). The median time to program enrollment was 1 day (range, 0-11) and to first visit was 5 days (range, 0-25). On the basis of the program intake form, 47 referrals were made across six specialties, most commonly physical medicine and rehabilitation (n = 10), radiation oncology (n = 10), and neuropsychology (n = 10). Nineteen patients (36%) consented to enroll in clinical trials.CONCLUSION:A tailored team-based care coordination program for patients with MBC and CNS metastases is feasible. Use of a unique intake screening form by a dedicated program coordinator resulted in faster time to first patient visit, enabled access to subspecialist care, and supported enrollment in clinical trials. Future research should focus on intervention development using PRO data collected in this care coordination program.",10.1200/OP.22.00291,Michigan Medicine,,8254377000.0,

We investigated primary care physicians' medical errors and perceived causes. We compared the results with previously reported U.S. data. Methods: Using a semi-structured instrument, we interviewed Japanese physicians about their most memorable medical errors and the perceived causes. We qualitatively analyzed interview transcripts to describe the errors and causes using a taxonomy including the categories: clinician factors, communication factors, administration factors, blunt-end factors, and patient-related factors. Results: Thirty-three Japanese primary care practitioners participated. Of 37 reported cases, 15 occurred in hospitals, and 22 occurred as outpatients. Misdiagnoses (n=10) and procedural complications (n=7) were the most commonly reported errors. The most commonly reported causes included being hurried/busy (n=19), underestimating the patient's condition (n=13), lack of follow-up (n=12) and being distracted (n=10). Cost and legal issues were raised as concerns less than in a similar U.S. study. Conclusions: The most common memorable medical errors reported by Japanese physicians included misdiagnoses and procedural complications. The causes of being hurried and lacking knowledge were found in similar proportions to a previous U.S. study. Socio-cultural differences between Japan and the U.S. such as legal and insurance system differences appear to influence physicians' perceptions of medical errors. These data demonstrate that serious medical errors occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings in Japan, and that primary care physicians can recognize and will discuss their errors.

Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility and cultural acceptability of a dementia-specific ACP communication skills toolkit for Japanese primary care clinicians. Methods: We delivered 13 training sessions in primary care clinics across central Japan and conducted a post-training survey to assess whether the toolkit increased confidence in dementia-specific ACP communication skills and the acceptability of the toolkit with the following four statements: (1) The language in the sessions was clear, (2) The sessions took an appropriate amount of time to complete, (3) The design of the sessions was an effective educational method, and (4) The sessions were culturally appropriate for communication with Japanese patients with dementia and their family members. We asked participants to respond using a 5-point Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Results: All participants were Japanese and included 80 physicians (mean age 39.8 years), 33 nurses (mean age 45.7 years), and 58 other participants (mean age 42.9 years), who were 30.0%, 87.9%, and 55.2% female, respectively. Most participants practiced in rural settings. In pre- post-comparisons, participant confidence increased in determining capacity, understanding dementia prognosis, goals of care, eliciting surrogates, recommending self-care practices to families, and leading family meetings (all p < 0.001). Most participants strongly agreed or agreed that the toolkit was an effective method (96.9%), took an appropriate amount of time (94.5%), contained clear language (89.8%), and was culturally appropriate (73.6%). Conclusions: Dementia-specific ACP communication skills toolkit can be delivered in Japan. Japanese primary care clinicians generally felt the dementia-specific ACP toolkit increased their confidence in ACP communication skills and was acceptable.

Limited information exists regarding the incidence of POP as women transition through menopause. Using data from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), this diverse community-based longitudinal cohort study assessed the incidence of symptomatic POP and risk by race/ethnicity. Methods: Self-reported POP was ascertained by questionnaire at 11 approximately annual SWAN visits over a median of 13.3 years of follow-up. We estimated probabilities for reporting POP using interval-censored Kaplan–Meier survival plots. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using interval-censored Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The estimated cumulative probability of POP increased linearly from 2.1% at age 45 to 10.1% by age 65 (4.0% per decade). At age 65, the probability was 4.2%, 4.8%, 8.9%, 9.7%, and 33.9% for Japanese, Chinese, Black, White, and Hispanic women, respectively. Compared with White women, the unadjusted HR for POP was 3.09 (95% CI = 2.18–4.39), 0.96 (0.71–1.31), 0.43 (0.22–0.85), and 0.48 (0.26–0.88) for Hispanic, Black, Chinese, and Japanese women, respectively. After adjustment for financial strain and vaginal birth, the low hazards among Chinese and Japanese women and the high hazard for Hispanic women remained significant. Conclusion: Incidence of symptomatic POP increased as women aged through midlife. Risks varied by race and ethnicity and were not accounted for by population differences in socioeconomic life contexts or the probability of having had a vaginal birth. Although not associated with menopause, health providers should incorporate screening for and information about POP when treating menopausal symptoms and health needs of midlife women. Research on pathophysiological factors associated with increasing POP in midlife is warranted.",10.1089/jwh.2023.0804,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Materials and Methods Surveys assessed health status, diagnoses, risk factors, and screening test outcomes for women with vulvodynia. Associations between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and obesity, CSA and vulvodynia, and obesity and vulvodynia were investigated. A multivariate model was used to determine if obesity mediates and/or modifies the relationship between CSA and vulvodynia. Results Of 2,277 women participating in the study, 1,647 completed survey data on CSA at 18 months, body mass index at 24 months, and vulvodynia over the first 54 months of the survey. Mean age was 50.9 ± 15.8 years. Overall, race and ethnicity were 77.4% White, 15.7% Black, 2.4% Hispanic, and 4.5% other. Five hundred thirty-nine participants (32.7%) were obese (body mass index >30) and 468 (28.4%) were overweight. Physical CSA before age of 18 years was reported by 20.0% (n = 329). During the study, 22.0% (n = 362) screened positive for vulvodynia on one or more surveys. After controlling for demographic variables, both obesity and screening positive for vulvodynia were associated with a history of CSA before age of 18 years (p =.013 and p <.001, respectively), but obesity was not associated with screening positive for vulvodynia (p =.865). In addition, multivariate analysis indicated no mediation of the CSA/vulvodynia relationship by obesity.

Methods: In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, 1,320 women aged 60.4 to 72.5 years self-collected (2015-2017) vaginal samples analyzed for microbiota composition and structure (CSTs) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, VMI, and pH. GSM symptoms were collected with self-administered questionnaires; interviewers elicited estrogen use and measured body mass index. Serum E2 and E1 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. We analyzed data using Pearson χ2 tests, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and binomial logistic regression. Results: The most frequently occurring CST was low Lactobacillus species IV-C (49.8%); 36.4% of women had CSTs dominated by Lactobacillus species. More than half of the women with vaginal atrophy biomarkers (VMI <50 and pH >5) had CST IV-C0, whereas women using estrogen or with higher E1 and E2 levels had a higher prevalence of Lactobacillus crispatus–dominated CST I (P values < 0.001). Sexual pain was associated with atrophy biomarkers and independently associated with Streptococcus species–dominated CST IV-C1 (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence intervals, 1.20-4.23). For all other GSM symptoms, we found no consistent associations with E1 or E2 levels, atrophy biomarkers, or any CST. Conclusions: Although close relationships exist among estrogen, CSTs, VMI, and pH, sexual pain was the only GSM symptom associated with the structure of vaginal microbiota and atrophy biomarkers.",10.1097/GME.0000000000002263,UC Davis School of Medicine,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods: Patients diagnosed with vulvodynia at a vulvovaginal specialty clinic were randomly assigned to receive either a one-on-one 30- to 45-min psychosocial counseling session with a psychosexual counselor plus written educational materials (intervention group) or written materials alone (control group). They completed a survey before and 6 weeks after randomization that included demographic information and validated measures of sexual function and illness perception. Results: Thirty-one of 38 (81.6%) women approached chose to participate; 26 of the 31 (83.9%) completed the 6-week follow-up survey. Only the intervention group showed improvement in knowledge about vulvovaginal and sexual health, as well as in most measures of improvement in illness perception, as measured by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (P < 0.05). When compared directly with those in the control group, patients in the intervention group reported increased understanding of their vulvar symptoms (P < 0.005) and lessened emotional impact of these symptoms (P = 0.035). Conclusion: Patients receiving one session of the one-on-one psychosocial counseling intervention reported improved understanding and lessened emotional impact of their vulvar symptoms, compared with the control group. This study suggests that improvement may occur following minimal intervention and supports the need for further study.",10.1002/ijgo.14321,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

The onset and maintenance of vulvodynia involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression and childhood maltreatment as well as cognitive–affective, behavioural and interpersonal factors. Given the absence of empirically supported treatment guidelines, a stepwise approach of pelvic floor physical therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy as well as medical management is suggested, with surgery as the last option. Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women and their partners, and imposes a profound personal and societal economic burden. In addition, women with vulvodynia are more likely to report other chronic pain conditions, which further alters their quality of life. Future efforts should aim to increase girls’, women’s and healthcare professionals’ education and awareness of vulvodynia, phenotype different subgroups of women based on biopsychosocial characteristics among more diverse samples, conduct longitudinal studies and improve clinical trial designs.",10.1038/s41572-020-0164-2,University of Montreal,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,
Barbara D Reed,Nerve Growth Factor and Selected Cytokines in Women with and Without Vulvodynia,2018.0,Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease,Article,cytokines; immune system; nerve growth factor; pain; vulvodynia,"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Objective The aim of the study was to assess the association between cytokines/neurokines after in vitro stimulation with Candida antigen or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in blood samples among women with and without vulvodynia. Materials and Methods Women with vulvodynia and asymptomatic controls at three offices at the University of Michigan were examined clinically and completed a comprehensive survey in this cross-sectional study. Cytokine/neurokine levels were determined on blood samples using established ELISA protocols. Analysis of 48 cases and 42 ethnically matched controls included descriptive statistics (median, minimal, and maximal levels of cytokines/neurokines), overall and in cases and controls. Because of left-censored measurements, interval censored survival analysis was used to assess the association between case/control status and pain characteristics with cytokine/neurokine levels. Results Participants ranged in age from 19 to 60 years. Levels of IL1β, IL1-RA, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-8 increased substantially after LPS stimulation, whereas no response was seen on IFNγ or nerve growth factor (NGF). Each increased after Candida antigen stimulation, although responses to Candida antigen stimulation of IL1β, IL-6, and TNFα were less robust than after LPS. Only NGF was significantly increased in vulvodynia cases compared with controls (Exp β (95% CI) = 2.08 [1.08-3.98]) after 24-hour Candida antigen stimulation and persisted when controlled for age, use of oral contraceptives, or history of Candida vulvovaginitis. No association between cytokine/neurokine levels and pain characteristics was found. Conclusions Compared with that of control women, whole blood from women with vulvodynia demonstrates an enhanced production of NGF, but not of a set of inflammation-related cytokines, in response to Candida antigen stimulation.",10.1097/LGT.0000000000000377,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,
Barbara D Reed,Factors associated with developing vaginal dryness symptoms in women transitioning through menopause: A longitudinal study,2018.0,Menopause,Article,Dyspareunia; Menopause; Sexual function; Vaginal dryness,"2018 by The North American Menopause SocietyObjective: To evaluate factors associated with incident self-reported vaginal dryness and the consequences of this symptom across the menopausal transition in a multiracial/ethnic cohort of community-dwelling women. Methods: We analyzed questionnaire and biomarker data from baseline and 13 approximately annual visits over 17 years (1996-2013) from 2,435 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a prospective cohort study. We used discrete-time Cox proportional-hazards regression to identify predictors of incident vaginal dryness and to evaluate vaginal dryness as a predictor of pain during intercourse and changes in sexual intercourse frequency. Results: The prevalence of vaginal dryness increased from 19.4% among all women at baseline (ages 42-53 years) to 34.0% at the 13th visit (ages 57-69 years). Advancing menopausal stage, surgical menopause, anxiety, and being married were positively associated with developing vaginal dryness, regardless of partnered sexual activity. For women not using hormone therapy, higher concurrent levels of endogenous estradiol were inversely associated (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.94 per 0.5 standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.98). Concurrent testosterone levels, concurrent dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and longitudinal change in any reproductive hormone were not associated with developing vaginal dryness. Both vaginal dryness and lubricant use were associated with subsequent reporting of pain during intercourse, but not with a decline in intercourse frequency. Conclusion: In these longitudinal analyses, our data support many clinical observations about the relationship between vaginal dryness, menopause, and pain during intercourse, and suggest that reporting of vaginal dryness is not related to androgen level or sexual intercourse frequency.",10.1097/GME.0000000000001130,UC Davis School of Medicine,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Barbara D Reed,Does Degree of Vulvar Sensitivity Predict Vulvodynia Characteristics and Prognosis?,2017.0,Journal of Pain,Article,cotton-swab test; diagnosis; vulvar sensitivity; vulvodolorimeter; Vulvodynia,"2016 American Pain SocietyAlthough women with vulvodynia typically have increased vulvar sensitivity, data on characteristics associated with the degree of vulvar sensitivity are lacking. We measured vulvar sensitivity using cotton swab test and vulvodolorimeter among a subset of 335 women, aged younger than 70 years, in the longitudinal Woman to Woman Health Study. Comparing the vulvodynia screening results from their online/paper survey to that at the time of the examination, 42 women had ongoing vulvodynia, 66 had a recent remission, 22 control participants had a recent onset of vulvodynia, and 205 control participants remained asymptomatic. Vulvar sensitivity was greater in each vulvodynia group compared with the control group (P < .001), and was associated with younger age at first onset of pain (P = .025), pain after intercourse (P = .008), describing the pain as a “pressure,” “burning,” or “irritating” (P = .015, P = .005, and P = .006, respectively), with increased severity of pain ever (P = .012), and with subsequent persistent or relapsing vulvodynia (P < .001 for each). A score of >1 for the cotton swab summary score best differentiated case from control participants (sensitivity 71.9%; specificity 72.0%). Although 13.8% of women with vulvodynia had no increased sensitivity on cotton swab testing, they did not differ in most clinical characteristics or clinical course from those with increased vulvar sensitivity. Perspective This study showed that women with vulvodynia have more vulvar sensitivity than control women, but the spectrum of sensitivity is broad. Furthermore, those with and without vulvar sensitivity did not differ in most vulvar pain characteristics or in prognosis, suggesting a positive swab test is not required to substantiate the diagnosis.",10.1016/j.jpain.2016.10.006,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

We sought to assess if a medical board Maintenance of Certification Part IV project could improve the delivery of confidential care to minor adolescent patients seen in outpatient primary care practices. Design Participating physicians reviewed 3 months of charts for patients ages 12-17 years seen for well visits during a baseline time period, and after 2 Plan, Do, Study, Act intervention cycles to assess if they had met confidentiality standards. Participating physicians additionally completed an assessment tool on personal and clinic practices related to confidentiality. Setting Nine academic and 3 private practice family medicine, pediatrics, and medicine-pediatrics sites. Participants Forty-four physicians. Interventions Provider and staff deficits in knowledge of minor consent laws, resistance toward the idea of confidential care, and work flow issues around confidential screening were identified as primary barriers. Staff and provider trainings, scripts, and staff involvement in planning work flows were identified as key interventions. Main Outcome Measures Improvement in confidentiality standards met during minor adolescent well visits. Results Participating physicians significantly increased the proportion of well visits in which they spent time alone with the patient (P = .001), explained minor consent laws (P < .001), and had the adolescent complete a confidential risk screening tool (P < .001), in addition to improving scores on their confidentiality assessment overall (P < .001). Conclusions A medical board Maintenance of Certification Part IV project is an effective way to change physician practice and improve the delivery of confidential care to minor adolescents seen for well visits.",10.1016/j.jpag.2016.08.006,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,
Barbara D Reed,Multimodal Vulvar and Peripheral Sensitivity among Women with Vulvodynia: A Case-Control Study,2017.0,Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease,Article,central sensitization; electricity; pressure; sensory testing; subgroups; vulvodynia,"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Objective To assess differences in vulvar and peripheral sensitivity between women with and without vulvodynia. Methods Women with vulvodynia (n = 41) and age-matched controls (n = 43) seen in the outpatient setting were evaluated via surveys, clinical examination, and multimodal sensory testing (pressure, heat, cold, vibration, and electrical stimulation). The relationships between sensitivity to various sensory modalities and case/control status, as well as by vulvodynia subgroups, were assessed using logistic regression. Results Women with vulvodynia were more sensitive to pressure and to electrical stimuli than were control women at the vulva (median, 22 vs 230 g and 0.495 vs 0.769 mA, respectively; P < 0.001 for each) and at the thumb (median, 2500 vs 4250 g and 0.578 vs 0.764 mA, respectively; P = 0.006 for pressure, P < 0.001 for electrical stimulation). Heat, cold, and vibration detection thresholds did not differ significantly between these groups (P > 0.025). Those reporting spontaneous pain versus provoked pain had greater pressure sensitivity to the thumb (median, 1850 vs 2690 g; P = 0.020) and greater electrical sensitivity at the introitus (0.450 vs 0.608 mA; P = 0.011), and those with primary versus secondary vulvodynia had substantially greater pressure sensitivity to the thumb (median, 2438 vs 3125 g, P = 0.004). However, having localized versus generalized vulvodynia was not associated with differences in pressure or electrical sensitivity. Conclusions Sensitivities to pressure and electrical stimuli are greater among vulvodynia cases than among controls and support 2 previously defined subgroups - those reporting spontaneous pain versus those whose pain only occurred when provoked, and those with primary versus secondary vulvodynia.",10.1097/LGT.0000000000000267,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods We enrolled 100 women aged 19 to 59 years with confirmed vulvodynia cases, 100 racially matched controls, and 100 black control women. All had vulvar biopsies performed at the 7 o'clock position of the vestibule, which were then immunostained to detect c-KIT protein. The numbers of c-KIT positive mast cells per ×400 magnification field were manually counted, and t tests and logistic regression were used to assess the association with case-control status. Results Of the biopsies, 235 were adequate samples for c-KIT testing for mast cells. The mast cell density was substantially lower in black control women (13.9 ± 10.9) in comparison to white control women (22.5 ± 13.2 p < 0.001): hence the analysis was confined to white cases and racially matched control women. Compared with racially matched controls, cases were younger, more likely to be married, and reported a higher household income. The average number of mast cells per ×400 magnification field overall was 19.1 ± 13.2 (range, 0-62). There was no difference in the mast cell count between racially matched cases (22.4 ± 13.9 per ×400 field) and controls (22.5 ± 13.2) in either the univariate or multivariable analyses. Within the group of cases, there was no difference in mast cell density based on the presence or absence of a variety of urogenital symptoms. Conclusions No difference in mast cell density in biopsies of the vestibule was found between white cases and racially matched controls. Black control women have a lower mast cell density compared with white control women.",10.1097/LGT.0000000000000221,The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods The new terminology was achieved in four steps. The first involved a terminology consensus conference with representatives of the three societies, held in April 2015. Then, an analysis of the relevant published studies was used to establish a level of evidence for each factor associated with vulvodynia. The terminology was amended based on feedback from members of the societies. Finally, each society's board accepted the new terminology. Results and Conclusion In 2015, the ISSVD, ISSWSH, and IPPS adopted a new vulvar pain and vulvodynia terminology that acknowledges the complexity of the clinical presentation and pathophysiology involved in vulvar pain and vulvodynia, and incorporates new information derived from evidence-based studies conducted since the last terminology published in 2003.",10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.02.167,Western Galilee Hospital,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

We sought to estimate the probability of and risk factors for remission, relapse, and persistence among women screening positive for vulvodynia. Methods: Survey-based assessment in a longitudinal population-based study of women (the Woman to Woman Health Study) who screened positive for vulvodynia and completed at least four follow-up surveys. Outcome measures included remission without relapse, relapse (after remission), and persistence of a positive vulvodynia screen. Multinomial regression was used to assess factors associated with outcomes. Results: Of 441 women screening positive for vulvodynia during the study, 239 completed 4 additional surveys. Of these, 23 (9.6%) had consistently positive vulvodynia screens, 121 (50.6%) remitted without relapse, and 95 (39.7%) relapsed following remission. Overall, factors associated with both relapse and persistence (compared with remission alone) included increased severity of pain ever (p < 0.001) or after intercourse (p = 0.03), longer duration of symptoms (p ≤ 0.001), and screening positive for fibromyalgia (p < 0.001). Factors associated with persistence (but not relapse) included more severe symptoms with intercourse (p = 0.001) and pain with oral sex (p = 0.003) or partner touch (p = 0.04). Factors associated with relapse (but not persistence) included having provoked pain (p = 0.001) or screening positive for interstitial cystitis (p = 0.05) at first positive vulvodynia screen. Demographic characteristics, age at pain onset, and whether vulvodynia was primary or secondary did not predict outcome. Conclusion: Remission of vulvodynia symptoms is common with approximately half of remitters experiencing a relapse within 6-30 months. Persistence without remission is the exception rather than the rule. Pain history and comorbid conditions were associated with the more severe outcomes of relapse and/or persistence compared with those who remitted only. These findings provide further support that vulvodynia is heterogeneous and often occurs in an episodic pattern.",10.1089/jwh.2015.5397,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Materials and Methods Included were participants in the longitudinal population-based study of vulvodynia in southeast Michigan who screened positive for vulvodynia at least once during the study. A cluster analysis using variables reflecting vulvar pain characteristics and comorbid pain conditions was conducted. Variables reflecting best separation of clusters were used to assign participants to subgroup categories. Demographic, psychiatric, general health, and other vulvar pain characteristics were summarized for each subgroup, followed by multinomial regression and pairwise comparisons of subgroups on these factors. Results Of 441 women screening positive for vulvodynia during the course of the study, 393 were eligible on the basis of data requirements. Cluster analysis suggested that best subgroup separation was based on the following 2 variables: (1) presence or absence of spontaneous vulvar pain and (2) presence or absence of other comorbid pain conditions. Subgroups did not differ by age or ethnicity. The subgroup having spontaneous pain and other comorbid conditions demonstrated greatest morbidity in general health measures, psychiatric disorders, and other vulvar pain measures. Primary versus secondary vulvodynia did not vary between subgroups and did not assist in subgroup separation in the cluster analysis. Discussion Subgroups based on exploratory cluster analysis demonstrated that presence of spontaneous pain and the presence of comorbid pain conditions resulted in best separation of groups. Presence of both spontaneous pain and other comorbid pain conditions identified the group with greatest morbidity.",10.1097/LGT.0000000000000166,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,
Barbara D Reed,Physician Knowledge and Attitudes around Confidential Care for Minor Patients,2015.0,Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology,Article,Adolescent health services; Confidentiality; Informed consent by minors; Parental notification; Privacy,"2015 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.Study Objective: Minor adolescent patients have a legal right to access certain medical services confidentially without parental consent or notification. We sought to assess physicians' knowledge of these laws, attitudes around the provision of confidential care to minors, and barriers to providing confidential care. Design: An anonymous online survey was sent to physicians in the Departments of Family Medicine, Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Pediatrics at the University of Michigan. Results: Response rate was 40% (259/650). The majority of physicians felt comfortable addressing sexual health, mental health, and substance use with adolescent patients. On average, physicians answered just over half of the legal knowledge questions correctly (mean 56.6%±16.7%). The majority of physicians approved of laws allowing minors to consent for confidential care (90.8%±1.7% approval), while substantially fewer (45.1%±4.5%) approved of laws allowing parental notification of this care at the physician's discretion. Most physicians agreed that assured access to confidential care should be a right for adolescents. After taking the survey most physicians (76.6%) felt they needed additional training on confidentiality laws. The provision of confidential care to minors was perceived to be most inhibited by insurance issues, parental concerns/relationships with the family, and issues with the electronic medical record. Conclusions: Physicians are comfortable discussing sensitive issues with adolescents and generally approve of minor consent laws, but lack knowledge about what services a minor can access confidentially. Further research is needed to assess best methods to educate physicians about minors' legal rights to confidential healthcare services.",10.1016/j.jpag.2014.08.008,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

All right resurved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adolescent vaccine rates are below goal in the United States. We sought to assess a medical student driven “vaccine blitz” at a middle school with a school-based health center (SBHC) as a means to increase vaccination. METHODS: Written and/or verbal consent was obtained for specific vaccines needed. Vaccines were given at the SBHC by a team of medical students, public health students, and SBHC staff. Students who received vaccines at the SBHC or primary care physician’s (PCP’s) office in the 3 weeks after consent was attempted were included as participating in the intervention. RESULTS: Of 184 potential participants, 183 lacked at least one vaccine. On the day of the vaccine blitz, 48 students were given 94 vaccines. During the entire intervention time, an additional 14 students received 38 vaccines at the SBHC, and 23 students received 34 vaccines from their PCP. In sum, 85 students received 166 vaccines from this intervention. Immunization rates increased above the state average for all recommended vaccines; rates of HPV, hepatitis A, and influenza vaccination were most affected. CONCLUSIONS: Medical student-driven vaccine blitzes within an SBHC are a feasible, replicable, and effective way to increase adolescent vaccination rates. In addition, the blitz provided preclinical medical students’ exposure to underserved populations, adolescent health as part of the breadth of family medicine, SBHCs, and community medicine and allowed for multidisciplinary work between medical students, public health students, physicians, and nurse practitioners.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

The present study aimed to describe the magnitude of the association of depression and posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD) with the presence of vulvodynia in a nonclinical population from southeastern Michigan. Methods: Baseline data from 1,795 women participating in the Woman to Woman Health Study, a multiethnic population-based study, was used for this analysis. Validated screening questionnaires were conducted to assess vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD. Modified Poisson regression models with a robust variance estimation were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between vulvodynia status and two mental health conditions, depression and PTSD. Results: In the adjusted models, women who screened positive for depression had a 53% higher prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.10) compared with women who screened negative for depression. Women who screened positive for PTSD had more than a two-fold increase in the prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.07, 5.25) compared with women who screened negative for PTSD. Conclusions: The increased prevalence of vulvodynia among those screening positive for depression or PTSD suggests that these disorders may contribute to the likelihood of reporting vulvodynia. Alternatively, vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD may have a common pathophysiological and risk profile.

All Rights Reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lack of quality mentorship has been identified as an impediment to a successful academic career. This study serves as a needs assessment to understand baseline mentoring among faculty in an academic department of family medicine and the existing relationships between mentorship, job satisfaction, and academic productivity before the department begins a structured mentorship program. METHODS: All faculty received an anonymous online survey inquiring about their current mentorship and their perception of the importance of mentorship, in addition to measures of job satisfaction and academic productivity. RESULTS: Of 62 faculty members completing the survey (83% of faculty), almost all indicated it is very or somewhat important to have a mentor (97%, n=60), although only 45% (n=28) reported having a current mentor. Junior faculty were less likely than senior faculty to be satisfied with their mentorship, particularly if they did not have a current mentor. Job satisfaction was high and was not associated with having a mentor. Faculty members with mentors were more likely to have presented a talk or poster nationally, to have taken on a new educational or leadership role, and to have had a greater volume of academic activities overall. CONCLUSIONS: Although faculty believe mentorship is important, less than half have a current mentor. Junior faculty are disproportionately dissatisfied by lack of mentorship. Mentorship was associated with some elements of academic productivity but not with job satisfaction. Further study of the impact of a more structured mentorship program is needed.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Design Longitudinal population-based study. Setting Four counties in south-east Michigan, USA. Population A population-based sample of women, aged 18 years and older, enrolled using random-digit dialling. Methods Enrolled women completed surveys that included information on demographic characteristics, health status, current symptoms, past and present OC use, and a validated screen for vulvodynia. The temporal relationship between OC use and subsequent symptoms of vulvodynia was assessed using Cox regression, with OC exposure modelled as a time-varying covariate. Main outcome measure Vulvodynia, as determined by validated screen. Results Women aged <50 years who provided data on OC use, completed all questions required for the vulvodynia screen, and had first sexual intercourse prior to the onset of vulvodynia symptoms were eligible (n = 906). Of these, 71.2% (n = 645) had used OCs. The vulvodynia screen was positive in 8.2% (n = 74) for current vulvodynia and in 20.8% (n = 188) for past vulvodynia. Although crude cross-tabulation suggested that women with current or past vulvodynia were less likely to have been exposed to OCs prior to the onset of pain (60.7%), compared with those without this disorder (69.3%), the Cox regression analysis identified no association between vulvodynia and previous OC use (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.81-1.43, P = 0.60). This null finding persisted after controlling for ethnicity, marital status, educational level, duration of use, and age at first OC use. Conclusion For women aged <50 years of age, OC use did not increase the risk of subsequent vulvodynia. © 2013 RCOG.",10.1111/1471-0528.12407,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods The new terminology was achieved in four steps. The first involved a terminology consensus conference with representatives of the three societies, held in April 2015. Then, an analysis of the relevant published studies was used to establish a level of evidence for each factor associated with vulvodynia. The terminology was amended based on feedback from members of the societies. Finally, each society's board accepted the new terminology. Results and Conclusion In 2015, the ISSVD, ISSWSH, and IPPS adopted a new vulvar pain and vulvodynia terminology that acknowledges the complexity of the clinical presentation and pathophysiology involved in vulvar pain and vulvodynia, and incorporates new information derived from evidence-based studies conducted since the last terminology published in 2003.",10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.02.167,Western Galilee Hospital,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

All right resurved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adolescent vaccine rates are below goal in the United States. We sought to assess a medical student driven “vaccine blitz” at a middle school with a school-based health center (SBHC) as a means to increase vaccination. METHODS: Written and/or verbal consent was obtained for specific vaccines needed. Vaccines were given at the SBHC by a team of medical students, public health students, and SBHC staff. Students who received vaccines at the SBHC or primary care physician’s (PCP’s) office in the 3 weeks after consent was attempted were included as participating in the intervention. RESULTS: Of 184 potential participants, 183 lacked at least one vaccine. On the day of the vaccine blitz, 48 students were given 94 vaccines. During the entire intervention time, an additional 14 students received 38 vaccines at the SBHC, and 23 students received 34 vaccines from their PCP. In sum, 85 students received 166 vaccines from this intervention. Immunization rates increased above the state average for all recommended vaccines; rates of HPV, hepatitis A, and influenza vaccination were most affected. CONCLUSIONS: Medical student-driven vaccine blitzes within an SBHC are a feasible, replicable, and effective way to increase adolescent vaccination rates. In addition, the blitz provided preclinical medical students’ exposure to underserved populations, adolescent health as part of the breadth of family medicine, SBHCs, and community medicine and allowed for multidisciplinary work between medical students, public health students, physicians, and nurse practitioners.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

The present study aimed to describe the magnitude of the association of depression and posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD) with the presence of vulvodynia in a nonclinical population from southeastern Michigan. Methods: Baseline data from 1,795 women participating in the Woman to Woman Health Study, a multiethnic population-based study, was used for this analysis. Validated screening questionnaires were conducted to assess vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD. Modified Poisson regression models with a robust variance estimation were used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between vulvodynia status and two mental health conditions, depression and PTSD. Results: In the adjusted models, women who screened positive for depression had a 53% higher prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.10) compared with women who screened negative for depression. Women who screened positive for PTSD had more than a two-fold increase in the prevalence of having vulvodynia (PR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.07, 5.25) compared with women who screened negative for PTSD. Conclusions: The increased prevalence of vulvodynia among those screening positive for depression or PTSD suggests that these disorders may contribute to the likelihood of reporting vulvodynia. Alternatively, vulvodynia, depression, and PTSD may have a common pathophysiological and risk profile. Prospective studies are needed to improve our understanding of the temporal relation between mental health conditions and vulvar pain.",10.1089/jwh.2014.5001,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

We measured vulvar sensitivity using cotton swab test and vulvodolorimeter among a subset of 335 women, aged younger than 70 years, in the longitudinal Woman to Woman Health Study. Comparing the vulvodynia screening results from their online/paper survey to that at the time of the examination, 42 women had ongoing vulvodynia, 66 had a recent remission, 22 control participants had a recent onset of vulvodynia, and 205 control participants remained asymptomatic. Vulvar sensitivity was greater in each vulvodynia group compared with the control group (P < .001), and was associated with younger age at first onset of pain (P = .025), pain after intercourse (P = .008), describing the pain as a “pressure,” “burning,” or “irritating” (P = .015, P = .005, and P = .006, respectively), with increased severity of pain ever (P = .012), and with subsequent persistent or relapsing vulvodynia (P < .001 for each). A score of >1 for the cotton swab summary score best differentiated case from control participants (sensitivity 71.9%; specificity 72.0%). Although 13.8% of women with vulvodynia had no increased sensitivity on cotton swab testing, they did not differ in most clinical characteristics or clinical course from those with increased vulvar sensitivity. Perspective This study showed that women with vulvodynia have more vulvar sensitivity than control women, but the spectrum of sensitivity is broad. Furthermore, those with and without vulvar sensitivity did not differ in most vulvar pain characteristics or in prognosis, suggesting a positive swab test is not required to substantiate the diagnosis.",10.1016/j.jpain.2016.10.006.,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

We evaluated the association between past environmental exposures and the presence of vulvodynia. Materials and Methods: The history of 28 lifetime environmental exposures was queried in the longitudinal population-based Woman-to-Woman Health Study on the 24-month follow-up survey. Relationships between these and vulvodynia case status were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Overall, 1585 women completed the 24-month survey, the required covariate responses, and questions required for case status assessment. Screening positive as a vulvodynia case was associated with history of exposures to home-sprayed chemicals (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides - odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-3.58, p < 0.0001), home rodent poison and mothballs (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25-2.09, p < 0.001), working with solvents and paints (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.68-3.70, p < 0.0001), working as a housekeeper/maid (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.42-3.00, p < 0.0001), working as a manicurist/hairdresser (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14-3.53, p < 0.05), and working at a dry cleaning facility (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.08-4.19, p < 0.05). When classified into nine individual environmental exposure categories and all included in the same model, significant associations remained for four categories (home-sprayed chemicals, home rodent poison or mothballs, paints and solvents, and working as a housekeeper). Conclusions: This preliminary evaluation suggests a positive association between vulvodynia and the reported history of exposures to a number of household and work-related environmental toxins.

Methods: We analyzed questionnaire and biomarker data from baseline and 13 approximately annual visits over 17 years (1996-2013) from 2,435 participants in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a prospective cohort study. We used discrete-time Cox proportional-hazards regression to identify predictors of incident vaginal dryness and to evaluate vaginal dryness as a predictor of pain during intercourse and changes in sexual intercourse frequency. Results: The prevalence of vaginal dryness increased from 19.4% among all women at baseline (ages 42-53 years) to 34.0% at the 13th visit (ages 57-69 years). Advancing menopausal stage, surgical menopause, anxiety, and being married were positively associated with developing vaginal dryness, regardless of partnered sexual activity. For women not using hormone therapy, higher concurrent levels of endogenous estradiol were inversely associated (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio: 0.94 per 0.5 standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.98). Concurrent testosterone levels, concurrent dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, and longitudinal change in any reproductive hormone were not associated with developing vaginal dryness. Both vaginal dryness and lubricant use were associated with subsequent reporting of pain during intercourse, but not with a decline in intercourse frequency. Conclusion: In these longitudinal analyses, our data support many clinical observations about the relationship between vaginal dryness, menopause, and pain during intercourse, and suggest that reporting of vaginal dryness is not related to androgen level or sexual intercourse frequency.",10.1097/GME.0000000000001130,UC Davis School of Medicine,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.Objective: To evaluate the impact of a single session of psychosocial counseling on patients with vulvodynia. Methods: Patients diagnosed with vulvodynia at a vulvovaginal specialty clinic were randomly assigned to receive either a one-on-one 30- to 45-min psychosocial counseling session with a psychosexual counselor plus written educational materials (intervention group) or written materials alone (control group). They completed a survey before and 6 weeks after randomization that included demographic information and validated measures of sexual function and illness perception. Results: Thirty-one of 38 (81.6%) women approached chose to participate; 26 of the 31 (83.9%) completed the 6-week follow-up survey. Only the intervention group showed improvement in knowledge about vulvovaginal and sexual health, as well as in most measures of improvement in illness perception, as measured by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (P < 0.05). When compared directly with those in the control group, patients in the intervention group reported increased understanding of their vulvar symptoms (P < 0.005) and lessened emotional impact of these symptoms (P = 0.035). Conclusion: Patients receiving one session of the one-on-one psychosocial counseling intervention reported improved understanding and lessened emotional impact of their vulvar symptoms, compared with the control group.

All Rights Reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lack of quality mentorship has been identified as an impediment to a successful academic career. This study serves as a needs assessment to understand baseline mentoring among faculty in an academic department of family medicine and the existing relationships between mentorship, job satisfaction, and academic productivity before the department begins a structured mentorship program. METHODS: All faculty received an anonymous online survey inquiring about their current mentorship and their perception of the importance of mentorship, in addition to measures of job satisfaction and academic productivity. RESULTS: Of 62 faculty members completing the survey (83% of faculty), almost all indicated it is very or somewhat important to have a mentor (97%, n=60), although only 45% (n=28) reported having a current mentor. Junior faculty were less likely than senior faculty to be satisfied with their mentorship, particularly if they did not have a current mentor. Job satisfaction was high and was not associated with having a mentor. Faculty members with mentors were more likely to have presented a talk or poster nationally, to have taken on a new educational or leadership role, and to have had a greater volume of academic activities overall. CONCLUSIONS: Although faculty believe mentorship is important, less than half have a current mentor. Junior faculty are disproportionately dissatisfied by lack of mentorship. Mentorship was associated with some elements of academic productivity but not with job satisfaction. Further study of the impact of a more structured mentorship program is needed.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods Women with vulvodynia (n = 41) and age-matched controls (n = 43) seen in the outpatient setting were evaluated via surveys, clinical examination, and multimodal sensory testing (pressure, heat, cold, vibration, and electrical stimulation). The relationships between sensitivity to various sensory modalities and case/control status, as well as by vulvodynia subgroups, were assessed using logistic regression. Results Women with vulvodynia were more sensitive to pressure and to electrical stimuli than were control women at the vulva (median, 22 vs 230 g and 0.495 vs 0.769 mA, respectively; P < 0.001 for each) and at the thumb (median, 2500 vs 4250 g and 0.578 vs 0.764 mA, respectively; P = 0.006 for pressure, P < 0.001 for electrical stimulation). Heat, cold, and vibration detection thresholds did not differ significantly between these groups (P > 0.025). Those reporting spontaneous pain versus provoked pain had greater pressure sensitivity to the thumb (median, 1850 vs 2690 g; P = 0.020) and greater electrical sensitivity at the introitus (0.450 vs 0.608 mA; P = 0.011), and those with primary versus secondary vulvodynia had substantially greater pressure sensitivity to the thumb (median, 2438 vs 3125 g, P = 0.004). However, having localized versus generalized vulvodynia was not associated with differences in pressure or electrical sensitivity.

Materials and Methods Women with vulvodynia and asymptomatic controls at three offices at the University of Michigan were examined clinically and completed a comprehensive survey in this cross-sectional study. Cytokine/neurokine levels were determined on blood samples using established ELISA protocols. Analysis of 48 cases and 42 ethnically matched controls included descriptive statistics (median, minimal, and maximal levels of cytokines/neurokines), overall and in cases and controls. Because of left-censored measurements, interval censored survival analysis was used to assess the association between case/control status and pain characteristics with cytokine/neurokine levels. Results Participants ranged in age from 19 to 60 years. Levels of IL1β, IL1-RA, TNFα, IL-6, and IL-8 increased substantially after LPS stimulation, whereas no response was seen on IFNγ or nerve growth factor (NGF). Each increased after Candida antigen stimulation, although responses to Candida antigen stimulation of IL1β, IL-6, and TNFα were less robust than after LPS. Only NGF was significantly increased in vulvodynia cases compared with controls (Exp β (95% CI) = 2.08 [1.08-3.98]) after 24-hour Candida antigen stimulation and persisted when controlled for age, use of oral contraceptives, or history of Candida vulvovaginitis. No association between cytokine/neurokine levels and pain characteristics was found.

We sought to assess physicians' knowledge of these laws, attitudes around the provision of confidential care to minors, and barriers to providing confidential care. Design: An anonymous online survey was sent to physicians in the Departments of Family Medicine, Internal Medicine-Pediatrics, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Pediatrics at the University of Michigan. Results: Response rate was 40% (259/650). The majority of physicians felt comfortable addressing sexual health, mental health, and substance use with adolescent patients. On average, physicians answered just over half of the legal knowledge questions correctly (mean 56.6%±16.7%). The majority of physicians approved of laws allowing minors to consent for confidential care (90.8%±1.7% approval), while substantially fewer (45.1%±4.5%) approved of laws allowing parental notification of this care at the physician's discretion. Most physicians agreed that assured access to confidential care should be a right for adolescents. After taking the survey most physicians (76.6%) felt they needed additional training on confidentiality laws. The provision of confidential care to minors was perceived to be most inhibited by insurance issues, parental concerns/relationships with the family, and issues with the electronic medical record. Conclusions: Physicians are comfortable discussing sensitive issues with adolescents and generally approve of minor consent laws, but lack knowledge about what services a minor can access confidentially. Further research is needed to assess best methods to educate physicians about minors' legal rights to confidential healthcare services.",10.1016/j.jpag.2014.08.008,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Materials and Methods Included were participants in the longitudinal population-based study of vulvodynia in southeast Michigan who screened positive for vulvodynia at least once during the study. A cluster analysis using variables reflecting vulvar pain characteristics and comorbid pain conditions was conducted. Variables reflecting best separation of clusters were used to assign participants to subgroup categories. Demographic, psychiatric, general health, and other vulvar pain characteristics were summarized for each subgroup, followed by multinomial regression and pairwise comparisons of subgroups on these factors. Results Of 441 women screening positive for vulvodynia during the course of the study, 393 were eligible on the basis of data requirements. Cluster analysis suggested that best subgroup separation was based on the following 2 variables: (1) presence or absence of spontaneous vulvar pain and (2) presence or absence of other comorbid pain conditions. Subgroups did not differ by age or ethnicity. The subgroup having spontaneous pain and other comorbid conditions demonstrated greatest morbidity in general health measures, psychiatric disorders, and other vulvar pain measures. Primary versus secondary vulvodynia did not vary between subgroups and did not assist in subgroup separation in the cluster analysis. Discussion Subgroups based on exploratory cluster analysis demonstrated that presence of spontaneous pain and the presence of comorbid pain conditions resulted in best separation of groups.

During the study, 22.0% (n = 362) screened positive for vulvodynia on one or more surveys. After controlling for demographic variables, both obesity and screening positive for vulvodynia were associated with a history of CSA before age of 18 years (p =.013 and p <.001, respectively), but obesity was not associated with screening positive for vulvodynia (p =.865). In addition, multivariate analysis indicated no mediation of the CSA/vulvodynia relationship by obesity. Conclusions Although obesity and vulvodynia were independently associated with a history of CSA, obesity did not mediate or modify the relationship between CSA and vulvodynia in adulthood.",10.1097/LGT.0000000000000799,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods: In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, 1,320 women aged 60.4 to 72.5 years self-collected (2015-2017) vaginal samples analyzed for microbiota composition and structure (CSTs) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, VMI, and pH. GSM symptoms were collected with self-administered questionnaires; interviewers elicited estrogen use and measured body mass index. Serum E2 and E1 were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. We analyzed data using Pearson χ2 tests, analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and binomial logistic regression. Results: The most frequently occurring CST was low Lactobacillus species IV-C (49.8%); 36.4% of women had CSTs dominated by Lactobacillus species. More than half of the women with vaginal atrophy biomarkers (VMI <50 and pH >5) had CST IV-C0, whereas women using estrogen or with higher E1 and E2 levels had a higher prevalence of Lactobacillus crispatus–dominated CST I (P values < 0.001). Sexual pain was associated with atrophy biomarkers and independently associated with Streptococcus species–dominated CST IV-C1 (odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence intervals, 1.20-4.23). For all other GSM symptoms, we found no consistent associations with E1 or E2 levels, atrophy biomarkers, or any CST. Conclusions: Although close relationships exist among estrogen, CSTs, VMI, and pH, sexual pain was the only GSM symptom associated with the structure of vaginal microbiota and atrophy biomarkers.",10.1097/GME.0000000000002263,UC Davis School of Medicine,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

We sought to estimate the probability of and risk factors for remission, relapse, and persistence among women screening positive for vulvodynia. Methods: Survey-based assessment in a longitudinal population-based study of women (the Woman to Woman Health Study) who screened positive for vulvodynia and completed at least four follow-up surveys. Outcome measures included remission without relapse, relapse (after remission), and persistence of a positive vulvodynia screen. Multinomial regression was used to assess factors associated with outcomes. Results: Of 441 women screening positive for vulvodynia during the study, 239 completed 4 additional surveys. Of these, 23 (9.6%) had consistently positive vulvodynia screens, 121 (50.6%) remitted without relapse, and 95 (39.7%) relapsed following remission. Overall, factors associated with both relapse and persistence (compared with remission alone) included increased severity of pain ever (p < 0.001) or after intercourse (p = 0.03), longer duration of symptoms (p ≤ 0.001), and screening positive for fibromyalgia (p < 0.001). Factors associated with persistence (but not relapse) included more severe symptoms with intercourse (p = 0.001) and pain with oral sex (p = 0.003) or partner touch (p = 0.04). Factors associated with relapse (but not persistence) included having provoked pain (p = 0.001) or screening positive for interstitial cystitis (p = 0.05) at first positive vulvodynia screen. Demographic characteristics, age at pain onset, and whether vulvodynia was primary or secondary did not predict outcome. Conclusion: Remission of vulvodynia symptoms is common with approximately half of remitters experiencing a relapse within 6-30 months. Persistence without remission is the exception rather than the rule. Pain history and comorbid conditions were associated with the more severe outcomes of relapse and/or persistence compared with those who remitted only. These findings provide further support that vulvodynia is heterogeneous and often occurs in an episodic pattern.",10.1089/jwh.2015.5397,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,

Methods We enrolled 100 women aged 19 to 59 years with confirmed vulvodynia cases, 100 racially matched controls, and 100 black control women. All had vulvar biopsies performed at the 7 o'clock position of the vestibule, which were then immunostained to detect c-KIT protein. The numbers of c-KIT positive mast cells per ×400 magnification field were manually counted, and t tests and logistic regression were used to assess the association with case-control status. Results Of the biopsies, 235 were adequate samples for c-KIT testing for mast cells. The mast cell density was substantially lower in black control women (13.9 ± 10.9) in comparison to white control women (22.5 ± 13.2 p < 0.001): hence the analysis was confined to white cases and racially matched control women. Compared with racially matched controls, cases were younger, more likely to be married, and reported a higher household income. The average number of mast cells per ×400 magnification field overall was 19.1 ± 13.2 (range, 0-62). There was no difference in the mast cell count between racially matched cases (22.4 ± 13.9 per ×400 field) and controls (22.5 ± 13.2) in either the univariate or multivariable analyses. Within the group of cases, there was no difference in mast cell density based on the presence or absence of a variety of urogenital symptoms. Conclusions No difference in mast cell density in biopsies of the vestibule was found between white cases and racially matched controls.

Barbara D. Reed,Vulvodynia,2020.0,Nature Reviews Disease Primers,Review,Vulvodynia; Vulvodynia,"2020, Springer Nature Limited.Vulvodynia is a condition that occurs in 8–10% of women of all ages and is characterized by pain at the vulva that is present during sexual and/or non-sexual situations. Diagnosis is established through careful medical history and pelvic examination, including the cotton-swab test. The onset and maintenance of vulvodynia involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression and childhood maltreatment as well as cognitive–affective, behavioural and interpersonal factors. Given the absence of empirically supported treatment guidelines, a stepwise approach of pelvic floor physical therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy as well as medical management is suggested, with surgery as the last option. Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women and their partners, and imposes a profound personal and societal economic burden. In addition, women with vulvodynia are more likely to report other chronic pain conditions, which further alters their quality of life. Future efforts should aim to increase girls’, women’s and healthcare professionals’ education and awareness of vulvodynia, phenotype different subgroups of women based on biopsychosocial characteristics among more diverse samples, conduct longitudinal studies and improve clinical trial designs.",10.1038/s41572-020-0164-2,University of Montreal,0000-0001-9256-840X,7202456097.0,2107178.0

The recommendations were developed by an expert working group appointed by ASCCP's Board of Directors. Working group 3 defined colposcopy procedure guidelines for minimum and comprehensive colposcopy practice and evaluated the use of colposcopy adjuncts. Materials and Methods The working group performed a systematic literature review to identify best practices in colposcopy methodology and to evaluate the use of available colposcopy adjuncts. The literature provided little evidence to support specific elements of the procedure. The working group, therefore, implemented a national survey of current and recent ASCCP members to evaluate common elements of the colposcopy examination. The findings of this survey were modified by expert consensus from the ASCCP Colposcopy Standards Committee members to create guidelines for performing colposcopy. The draft recommendations were posted online for public comment and presented at an open session of the International Federation for Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy 2017 World Congress for further comment. All comments were considered in the development of final recommendations. Results Minimum and comprehensive colposcopy practice guidelines were developed. These guidelines represent recommended practice in all parts of the examination including the following: precolposcopy evaluation, performing the procedure, documentation of findings, biopsy practice, and postprocedure follow-up.

Traditional grading systems do not accurately assess lesion severity because colposcopic impression alone is unreliable for diagnosis. The likelihood of finding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher increases when two or more cervical biopsies are performed. Excisional and ablative methods have similar treatment outcomes for the eradication of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. However, diagnostic excisional methods, including loop electrosurgical excision procedure and cold knife conization, are associated with an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes, such as preterm labor and low birth weight. Methods of endometrial assessment have a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial carcinoma and benign causes of uterine bleeding without unnecessary procedures. Endometrial biopsy can reliably detect carcinoma involving a large portion of the endometrium, but is suboptimal for diagnosing focal lesions. A 3- to 4-mm cutoff for endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasonography yields the highest sensitivity to exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women. Saline infusion sonohysteroscopy can differentiate globally thickened endometrium amenable to endometrial biopsy from focal abnormalities best assessed by hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy with directed biopsy is the most sensitive and specific method of diagnosing endometrial carcinoma, other than hysterectomy. © 2013 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Michigan Medicine,0009-0008-6912-2758,7003868850.0,

The guidelines incorporate the Bethesda System 2001 terminology and data from randomized studies of atypical squamous cells, low-grade intraepithelial lesions, human papillomavirus testing, and liquid-based cytology to formulate evidence-based recommendations. Each recommendation is graded according to the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence, and specific terminology is added to highlight management options. The effectiveness of each triage recommendation is determined by the percentage of grade 2 and 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia it detects. Colposcopy, repeat cytology, and human papillomavirus DNA testing are acceptable options in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, but human papillomavirus DNA testing is preferred if liquid-based cytology is used. Colposcopy is recommended for women with a diagnosis of ""atypical squamous cells-cannot rule out high-grade intraepithelial lesion."" Women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be referred for colposcopy, and women with high-grade lesions should undergo colposcopy and endocervical assessment. Colposcopy and endocervical sampling are recommended in women with all subcategories of atypical glandular cells. Endometrial sampling and colposcopy are recommended in women older than 35 years with atypical glandular cells and in younger women with unexplained vaginal bleeding. Women with a diagnosis of ""atypical glandular cells-favor neoplasia"" or adenocarcinoma-in-situ who are not found to have invasive disease on colposcopy should undergo a diagnostic excisional procedure, preferably a cold-knife conization.

This study examined parental opinions and compared these with those of the medical professional. Methods: Physicians independently assessed complications and cosmetic outcome following the circumcision. Six weeks post-circumcision, parental report of complications, cosmetic outcome, and overall satisfaction were assessed. Results: Newborn infants (n = 710) were prospectively recruited and underwent either a Gomco [n = 552 (78 %)] or Plastibell® [n = 158 (22 %)] circumcision. Physician assessed complication rates were equivalent (Gomco 4.3 % versus Plastibell 5.1 %; p = 0.67), however, parental assessment found a much lower complication rate for Gomco 5.6 % versus Plastibell 12.0 % (p < 0.001). There was no difference between who performed the procedure nor between the techniques in regards to parental rating of overall satisfaction (excellent/good: Gomco 96.9 % versus Plastibell 95.6 %, p = 0.45). However, perceived post-operative pain as scored by parents was significantly higher in patients undergoing Plastibell procedure (6.4 % too much pain) versus Gomco (2.7 %; p = 0.05). Gomco accounted for 72.7 % of parental cosmetically unsatisfactory cases. Conclusions: Clinicians and parents differed considerably in terms of opinion of cosmetic outcome and occurrence of post-operative complications.

Universal screening for GBS among women at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation is more effective than administration of intrapartum antibiotics based on risk factors. Lower vaginal and rectal cultures for GBS are collected at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation, and routine clindamycin and erythromycin susceptibility testing is performed in women allergic to penicillin. Women with GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy and those who previously delivered a GBS-septic newborn are not screened but automatically receive intrapartum antibiotics. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is selected based on maternal allergy history and susceptibility of GBS isolates. Intravenous penicillin G is the preferred antibiotic, with ampicillin as an alternative. Penicillin G should be administered at least four hours before delivery for maximum effectiveness. Cefazolin is recommended in women allergic to penicillin who are at low risk of anaphylaxis. Clindamycin and erythromycin are options for women at high risk for anaphylaxis, and vancomycin should be used in women allergic to penicillin and whose cultures indicate resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin or when susceptibility is unknown. Asymptomatic neonates born to GBS-colonized mothers should be observed for at least 24 hours for signs of sepsis. Newborns who appear septic should have diagnostic work-up including blood culture followed by initiation of ampicillin and gentamicin. Studies indicate that intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS carriers and selective administration of antibiotics to newborns reduce neonatal GBS sepsis by as much as 80 to 95 percent.

The Papanicolaou (Pap) test remains the basis of cervical cancer prevention. Cervical cancer is treatable, curable, if detected early, and now possibly preventable by vaccine. Cervical cancer has become a problem of access and public health. Cervical cancer: There are approximately 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer yearly in the USA and approximately 4000 deaths from cervical cancer. In 2005, there were approximately 9700 new cases and 3700 deaths from cervical cancer in the USA (Figure 15.1). Non-white races have greater incidence of both cervical cancer and death from cervical cancer. Risk factors include HPV infection and never having had a Pap test. Non-whites have a higher incidence of cervical cancer and death from cervical cancer, but this may be caused more by access and screening than genetic tendency. The Pap test and its limitations: The goal of the Pap test-cervical cytology screening-is to detect precancerous and cancerous lesions at a point when they can be treated and to initiate further evaluation based on the cytological diagnosis. The conventional Pap smear has been used for 50 years and is one of the most effective screening tests developed. Since its introduction by Herbert Traut in 1942, the Pap smear has become the most widely used cancer screening test. The effectiveness of the Pap smear is proportional to the number of tests a woman has had in her life.",10.1017/CBO9780511642111.015,Chelsea Medical System,0009-0008-6912-2758,7003868850.0,

The classic definition of menorrhagia (i.e., greater than 80 mL of blood loss per cycle) is rarely used clinically. Women describe the loss or reduction of daily activities as more important than the actual volume of bleeding. Routine testing of all women with menorrhagia for inherited coagulation disorders is unnecessary. Saline infusion sonohysteroscopy detects intracavitary abnormalities such as endometrial polyps or uterine leiomyoma and is less expensive and invasive than hysteroscopy. Endometrial biopsy is effective for diagnosing precancerous lesions and adenocarcinoma but not for intracavitary lesions. Except for continuous progestin, medical therapies are limited. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is an effective therapy for women who want to preserve fertility and avoid surgery. Surgical therapies include endometrial ablation methods that preserve the uterus; and hysterectomy, which results in high satisfaction rates but with potential surgical morbidity. Overall, hysterectomy and endometrial ablation result in the greatest satisfaction rates if future childbearing is not desired. Treatment of menorrhagia results in substantial improvement in quality of life. Copyright © 2007 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Michigan Medicine,0009-0008-6912-2758,7003868850.0,

The 2006 guidelines include recommendations for special populations (i.e., adolescents and pregnant women). Human papillomavirus testing is now included for management of atypical glandular cytology, for follow-up after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and in combination with cytologic screening in women 30 years and older. The preferred management of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance in adult women is reflex human papillomavirus DNA testing. Colposcopy is recommended for adult women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical glandular cells, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 can be managed conservatively in adult women, but treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grades 2 and 3 is recommended. Immediate treatment is an option for adult women but not for adolescents with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Conservative management of adolescents with any cytologic or histologic diagnosis except specified cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ is recommended. Colposcopy is preferred for pregnant women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, but evaluation of the former may be deferred until no earlier than six weeks postpartum. Treatment during pregnancy is unacceptable unless invasive carcinoma is identified.

Ussher, Joan C. Chrisler and Janette Perz; individual chapters, the contributors. All rights reserved.Impairment alone does not define the experiences of reproductive and sexual health and health care for women with disabilities. Instead, lack of provision of services, lack of accessibility of services, problems with service delivery, and lack of medical knowledge and training affect women’s ability to secure quality reproductive and sexual health care when they have a disability. Negative attitudes towards women with disabilities also impact reproductive and sexual choices and experiences. This chapter discusses basic barriers to good reproductive and sexual health and health care for women with disabilities, focusing on the case of women with spinal cord injuries. While many women with spinal cord injuries report having satisfactory reproductive and sexual lives, they also report difficulties managing menstruation, handling conversations with doctors about whether they can (or should) get pregnant or use contraception, and thinking about whether or how to engage in intimate relationships post-injury. Understanding the reasons for varied reproductive and sexual experiences is critical if we care about ensuring good health and health care for women with disabilities.",10.4324/9781351035620-39,Wayne State University,0009-0001-8763-7543,57215131298.0,

Brianna Abbate Marzolf,Reframing Our Health Care System for Patients With Hearing Loss,2022.0,"Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research",Review,"report hearing, reframing health, patients hearing, care patients, resources hearing, hearing loss, hearing","2022 The Authors.Purpose: Nearly 20% of U.S. Americans report a hearing loss, yet our current health care system is poorly designed and equipped to effectively care for these individuals. Individuals with hearing loss report communication breakdowns, inaccessible health information, reduced awareness and training by health care providers, and decreased satisfaction while struggling with inadequate health lit-eracy. These all contribute to health inequities and increased health care expen-ditures and inefficiencies. It is time to reframe the health care system for these individuals using existing models of best practices and accessibility to mitigate inequities and improve quality of care. Method: A review of system-, clinic-, provider-, and patient-level barriers, along with existing and suggested efforts to improve care for individuals with hearing loss, are presented. Results: These strategies include improving screening and identification of hearing loss, adopting universal design and inclusion principles, implementing effective communication approaches, leveraging assistive technologies and training, and diversifying a team to better care for patients with hearing loss. Patients should also be encouraged to seek social support and resources from hearing loss organizations while leveraging technologies to help facilitate communication. Conclusions: The strategies described introduce actionable steps that can be made at the system, clinic, provider, and patient levels. With implementation of these steps, significant progress can be made to more proactively meet the needs of patients with hearing loss.

All rights reserved.When physicians have a disability or chronic condition, they can offer deeper insight and ability into managing the needs of patients with similar conditions. Yet an alarming 2021 survey found that only 40.7% of physicians feel confident that they provide the same level of care to people with disabilities (PWD) as those without. This may contribute to troubling health care disparities for the over 61 million Americans living with disabilities. In a recent report, The American Medical Association (AMA) recognized that increased concordance between patients and physicians with disabilities is key to resolving health care inequities for PWD, yet although 1 in 5 patients reports a disability, only 1 in 33 physicians identifies as such. This is because prospective medical students with disabilities face many barriers in medical education and practice. We call for specific changes to medical school admission processes and curricula to promote a more just and diverse workforce which includes more physicians with disabilities.",10.1370/afm.2824,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,57215131298.0,

Methods: A total of 606 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate (TRUS) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of MPCs for comparison. We used the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) as a LUTS parameter. Multivariate analysis was performed to find out independent predictors for moderate to severe LUTS. An MPC subgroup analysis was done to look for linear correlation between the size of MPCs and LUTS. Results: Patients with no MPCs were of higher age, had more history of diabetes, were taking more urological medications, and had more IPSS storage symptoms. No significant differences were found in body mass index, total IPSS, voiding IPSS, bother score, total prostate-specific antigen level, and the prostate size. Multivariate analysis revealed age, history of diabetes, taking urological medications, and the prostate size as independent predictors of moderate to severe LUTS. The presence of MPCs was not an independent factor. Subgroup analysis failed to show significant correlation between the size of MPCs and the LUTS scores. Conclusions: The presence of MPCs is not an independent factor for moderate to severe LUTS, and the size of the MPCs does not have any correlation to LUTS scores either.",10.1111/luts.12288,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4505-2368,59111285700.0,

Despite the rapidly growing understanding of germline variants in driving aggressive prostate cancer and the increased availability of genetic testing, there is little evidence surrounding how best to screen these men. Methods: We are reporting on the first 45 patients enrolled, men between the ages of 35–75, primarily with known pathogenic germline variants in prostate cancer susceptibility genes. Screening consists of an intake lifestyle survey, PSA, DRE, and SelectMDx urine assay. A biopsy was recommended for any of the following indications: 1) abnormal DRE, 2) PSA above threshold, or 3) SelectMDx above threshold. The primary outcomes were number needed to screen, and number needed to biopsy to diagnose a patient with prostate cancer. Results: Patients enrolled in the clinic included those with BRCA1 (n=7), BRCA2 (n=16), Lynch Syndrome (n=6), and CHEK2 (n = 4) known pathogenic germline variants. The median age and PSA were 58 (range 35–71) and 1.4 ng/ml (range 0.1–11.4 ng/ml), respectively. 12 patients underwent a prostate needle biopsy and there were 4positive biopsies for prostate cancer. Conclusion: These early data support the feasibility of opening a dedicated clinic for men at high genetic risk of prostate cancer. This early report on the initial enrollment of our long-term study will help optimize early detection protocols and provide evidence for personalized prostate cancer screening in men with key pathogenic germline variants.",10.1016/j.urology.2021.05.078,Michigan Medicine,0000-0003-4505-2368,59111285700.0,

This change raised much controversy. We conducted this study to compare the impact of tight (TBPC) versus standard BP control (SBPC) on the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Methods: We retrospectively identified all hypertensive patients in an ambulatory setting based on the diagnostic code for 1 year at our institution who were classified by the range of BP across 3 years into 2 groups of TBPC (< 130 mmHg) and SBPC (130-139 mmHg). We compared the incidence of new MI and stroke between the 2 groups across a 2-year follow-up. Multivariate analysis was done to identify independent predictors for the incidence of new MI and stroke. Results: Of 5640 study patients, the TBPC group showed significantly less incidence of stroke compared to the SBPC group (1.5% vs. 2.7%, P < 0.010). No differences were found in MI incidence between the 2 groups (0.6% vs. 0.8%, P = 0.476). Multivariate analysis showed that increased age independently increased the incidence of both MI (OR 1.518, 95% CI 1.038-2.219) and stroke (OR 1.876, 95% CI 1.474-2.387), and TBPC independently decreased the incidence of stroke (OR 0.583, 95% CI 0.374-0.910) but not of MI. Conclusions: Our observational study suggests that TBPC may be beneficial in less stroke incidence compared to SBPC but it didn't seem to affect the incidence of MI.

This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Health Services Research published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Health Research and Educational Trust.Objectives: To describe the impacts of four Veterans Health Administration (VA) Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) projects implementing an evidence-based lifestyle intervention known as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Data Sources and Study Setting: 2012–2024 VA administrative and survey data. Study Design: This is a summary of findings and impacts from four effectiveness-implementation projects focused on in-person and/or online DPP across VA sites. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Patient demographics, participation data, and key findings and impacts were summarized across reports from the VA Diabetes-Mellitus Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI-DM) Diabetes Prevention Program (VA DPP) Trial, QUERI-DM Online DPP Trial, the Enhancing Mental and Physical Health of Women through Engagement and Retention (EMPOWER) QUERI DPP Project, and EMPOWER 2.0 QUERI Program. Principal Findings: Between 2012 and 2024, four VA QUERI studies enrolled 963 Veterans in DPP across 16 VA sites. All participants had overweight/obesity with one additional risk factor for type 2 diabetes (i.e., prediabetes, elevated risk score, or history of gestational diabetes) and 56% (N = 536) were women. In addition to enhancing the reach of and engagement in diabetes prevention services among Veterans, these projects resulted in three key impacts as follows: (1) informing the national redesign of VA MOVE! including recommendations to increase the number of MOVE! sessions and revise guidelines across 150+ VA sites, (2) enhancing the national evidence base to support online DPP delivery options with citations in national care guidelines outside VA, and (3) demonstrating the importance of gender-tailoring of preventive care services by and for women Veterans to enhance engagement in preventive services. Conclusions: Over the past decade, the evolution of VA QUERI DPP projects increased the reach of and engagement in diabetes prevention services among Veterans, including women Veterans who have been harder to engage in lifestyle change programs in VA, and resulted in three key impacts informing type 2 diabetes and obesity prevention efforts within and outside of VA.",10.1111/1475-6773.14349,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Caroline R Richardson,"Effects of an Intervention to Improve Evidence-Based Care for People with Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Across Sex, Race, and Ethnicity Subgroups: Insights from the COORDINATE-Diabetes Trial",2024.0,Circulation,Article,"cardiovascular diseases; clinical trial; diabetes mellitus, type 2; evidence-based medicine; health disparate minority and vulnerable populations","2024 American Heart Association, Inc.BACKGROUND: Results from the COORDINATE-Diabetes trial (Coordinating Cardiology Clinics Randomized Trial of Interventions to Improve Outcomes - Diabetes) demonstrated that a multifaceted, clinic-based intervention increased prescription of evidence-based medical therapies to participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This secondary analysis assessed whether intervention success was consistent across sex, race, and ethnicity. METHODS: COORDINATE-Diabetes, a cluster randomized trial, recruited participants from 43 US cardiology clinics (20 randomized to intervention and 23 randomized to usual care). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of evidence-based therapy (high-intensity statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist) at last trial assessment (6 to 12 months). In this prespecified analysis, mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to assess the outcome by self-reported sex, race, and ethnicity in the intervention and usual care groups, with adjustment for baseline characteristics, medications, comorbidities, and site location. RESULTS: Among 1045 participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the median age was 70 years, 32% were female, 16% were Black, and 9% were Hispanic. At the last trial assessment, there was an absolute increase in the proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of evidence-based therapy in women (36% versus 15%), Black participants (41% versus 18%), and Hispanic participants (46% versus 18%) with the intervention compared with usual care, with consistent benefit across sex (male versus female; Pinteraction=0.44), race (Black versus White; Pinteraction=0.59), and ethnicity (Hispanic versus Non-Hispanic; Pinteraction= 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The COORDINATE-Diabetes intervention successfully improved delivery of evidence-based care, regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity. Widespread dissemination of this intervention could improve equitable health care quality, particularly among women and minority communities who are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials.

Weight management treatments (WMT) include nutrition counseling, very low-calorie meal replacement (MR), antiobesity medications (AOM), and bariatric surgery; however, little is known about howtheseWMT are associated withweight change among individual patients and populations. OBJECTIVE To characterize weight status and WMT use among primary care patients and assess associations between WMT and weight trajectories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective, population-based cohort study of primary care patients from 1 academic health system in Michigan between October 2015 and March 2020 using cross-sectional analysis to compare obesity prevalence and WMT utilization. For patients with obesity and WMT exposure or matched controls, a multistate Markov model assessing associations between WMT and longitudinal weight status trajectories was used. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to October 2023. EXPOSURES Cross-sectional exposure was year: 2017 or 2019. Trajectory analysis exposures were WMT: nutrition counseling, MR, AOM, and bariatric surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cross-sectional analysis compared mean body mass index (BMI), obesity prevalence, and, among patients with obesity, prospective WMT use. The trajectory analysis examined longitudinal weight status using thresholds of ± 5% and 10% of baseline weight with primary outcomes being the 1-year probabilities of 5%or greater weight loss for each WMT. RESULTS Adult patients (146 959 participants) consisted of 83 636 female participants (56.9%); 8940 (6.1%) were Asian, 14 560 (9.9%) were Black, and 116 664 (79.4%) were White. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 49.6 (17.7) years and mean (SD) BMI of 29.2 (7.2). Among 138 682 patients, prevalence of obesity increased from 39.2%in 2017 to 40.7%in 2019;WMTuse among patients with obesity increased from 5.3%to 7.1% (difference: 1.7%; 95%CI, 1.3%-2.2%). In a multistate model (10 180 patients; 33 549 patient-years), the 1-year probability of 5%or greater weight loss without WMT exposure was 15.6%(95%CI, 14.3%-16.5%) at reference covariates. In contrast, the probability of 5%or greater weight loss was more likely with year-long exposures to any WMT (nutrition counseling: 23.1%; 95%CI, 21.3%-25.1%; MR: 54.6%; 95%CI, 46.5%-61.2%; AOM: 27.8%; 95%CI, 25.0%-30.5%; bariatric surgery: 93.0%; 95%CI, 89.7%-95.0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study of primary-care patients with obesity, all WMT increased the patient-level probability of achieving 5%or greater weight loss, but current rates of utilization are low and insufficient to reduce weight at the population level.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.56183,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

This article has been contributed to by U.S. Government employees and their work is in the public domain in the USA.Purpose: This secondary exploratory analysis examined rural-urban differences in response to a web-based physical activity self-management intervention for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: Participants with COPD (N = 239 US Veterans) were randomized to either a multicomponent web-based intervention (goal setting, iterative feedback of daily step counts, motivational and educational information, and an online community forum) or waitlist-control for 4 months with a 12-month follow-up. General linear modeling estimated the impact of rural/urban status (using Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA] codes) on (1) 4- and 12-month daily step-count change compared to waitlist-control, and (2) intervention engagement (weekly logons and participant feedback). Findings: Rural (n = 108) and urban (n = 131) participants’ mean age was 66.7±8.8 years. Rural/urban status significantly moderated 4-month change in daily step counts between randomization groups (p = 0.041). Specifically, among urban participants, intervention participants improved by 1500 daily steps more than waitlist-control participants (p = 0.001). There was no difference among rural participants. In the intervention group, rural participants engaged less with the step-count graphs on the website than urban participants at 4 months (p = 0.019); this difference dissipated at 12 months. More frequent logons were associated with greater change in daily step counts (p = 0.004); this association was not moderated by rural/urban status. Conclusions: The web-based intervention was effective for urban, but not rural, participants at 4 months. Rural participants were also less engaged at 4 months, which may explain differences in effectiveness. Technology-based interventions can help address urban-rural disparities in patients with COPD, but may also contribute to them unless resources are available to support engagement with the technology.",10.1111/jrh.12765,Boston University Chobanian &amp; Avedisian School of Medicine,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a widely implemented 12-month behavioural weight loss programme for individuals with prediabetes. The DPP covers nutrition but does not explicitly incorporate cooking skills education. The objective of the current study is to describe food and cooking skills (FACS) and strategies of recent DPP participants. Design: Photo-elicitation in-depth interviews were conducted from June to August, 2021. Setting: Baltimore, MD, USA. Participants: Thirteen Black women who participated in DPP. Results: The DPP curriculum influenced participants' healthy cooking practices. Many participants reported shifting from frying foods to air-frying and baking foods to promote healthier cooking and more efficient meal preparation. Participants also reported that their participation in DPP made them more mindful of consuming fruits and vegetables and avoiding foods high in carbohydrates, fats, sugars and Na. With respect to food skills, participants reported that they were more attentive to reading labels and packaging on foods and assessing the quality of ingredients when grocery shopping. Conclusions: Overall, participants reported changing their food preferences, shopping practices and cooking strategies to promote healthier eating after completing the DPP. Incorporating hands-on cooking skills and practices into the DPP curriculum may support sustained behaviour change to manage prediabetes and prevent development of type 2 diabetes among participants.",10.1017/S1368980023001106,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Peer support programs improve clinical outcomes among adults with Type 2 diabetes, but their effectiveness in diabetes prevention is unknown. This study examined whether a low-intensity peer support program improved outcomes more than enhanced usual care in a diverse population with prediabetes. Study design: The intervention was tested in a pragmatic 2-arm RCT. Setting/participants: Participants were adults with prediabetes at three healthcare centers. Intervention: Participants randomized to the enhanced usual care arm received educational materials. Participants in the Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes arm were matched with a peer supporter: another patient who had made healthy lifestyle changes and was trained in autonomy-supportive action planning. Peer supporters were instructed to provide weekly telephone support to their peers on specific action steps toward behavioral goals for 6 months, then monthly support for 6 months. Main outcome measures: Changes in primary outcomes of weight and HbA1c and secondary outcomes of enrollment in formal diabetes prevention programs, self-reported diet, physical activity, health-specific social support, self-efficacy, motivation, and activation at 6 and 12 months were examined. Results: Data collection occurred from October 2018 to March 2022, with analyses completed in September 2022. Among 355 randomized patients, in intention-to-treat analyses, there were no between-group differences in HbA1c or weight changes at 6 and 12 months. Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes participants were more likely to enroll in structured programs at 6 (AOR=2.45, p=0.009) and 12 (AOR=2.21, p=0.016) months and to report eating whole grains at 6 (4.49, p=0.026) and 12 (4.22, p=0.034) months. They reported greater improvements in perceived social support for diabetes prevention behaviors at 6 (6.39, p<0.001) and 12 (5.48, p<0.001) months, with no differences in other measures. Conclusions: A stand-alone, low-intensity peer support program improved social support and participation in formal diabetes prevention programs but not weight or HbA1c. It will be important to examine whether peer support could effectively complement higher-intensity, structured diabetes prevention programs.

Design: Photograph-elicitation in-depth interviews and survey measures. Setting: Baltimore, Maryland (June–August 2021). Participants: Black women (n = 13) who participated in DPP. Phenomenon of Interest: Food agency and strategies used to procure and prepare food and the influence of DPP on daily food behaviors. Surveys measured food agency using the Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale and cooking behaviors. Analysis: Thematic analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews and descriptive statistics for quantitative measures. Results: As quantitative and qualitative data revealed, participants were frequent and confident cooks with high food agency. Participants viewed cooking as a key strategy for healthy eating and desired more hands-on cooking instruction within DPP to develop new healthy cooking skills. The primary barriers identified were related to lack of time or energy. Food procurement and preparation practices shifted over time, and DPP was a key influence on current behaviors. Conclusions and Implications: Food agency is complex and manifests heterogeneously in daily life.

However, significant barriers limit access and adherence to PR and alternatives are needed. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of a web-based, pedometer-mediated intervention to increase physical activity (PA) for persons with COPD who decline PR or meet U.S. guidelines for referral to PR but have not participated (CAPRI-1). In addition, we will test whether the intervention maintains PA following PR in an exploratory aim (CAPRI-2). Methods: Participants with COPD (N = 120) will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to a 12-week web-based, pedometer-mediated intervention or usual care (UC) (CAPRI-1). The intervention provides: 1) objective monitoring of walking and iterative feedback, 2) individualized step-count goals, 3) motivational messages and educational content, and 4) an online community. The primary outcome is change in daily step count from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include: (a) exercise capacity; (b) self-reported PA; (c) PA intensity; (d) exercise self-regulatory efficacy, (e) health-related quality of life, (f) dyspnea, (g) depression symptoms, and (h) healthcare utilization. CAPRI-2 will test whether participants (N = 96) assigned to the intervention following PR completion show greater maintenance of daily step count compared to UC at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Discussion: If the intervention is efficacious, it may be an alternative for those who cannot attend PR or a maintenance program following completion of conventional PR.

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Adults with a triple multimorbidity (hypertension, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, and overweight or obesity), are at increased risk of serious health complications, but experts disagree on which dietary patterns and support strategies should be recommended. METHODS We randomized 94 adults from southeast Michigan with this triple multimorbidity using a 2 × 2 diet-by-support factorial design, comparing a very low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet vs a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, as well as comparing results with and without multicomponent extra support (mindful eating, positive emotion regulation, social support, and cooking). RESULTS Using intention-to-treat analyses, compared with the DASH diet, the VLC diet led to greater improvement in estimated mean systolic blood pressure (–9.77 mm Hg vs –5.18 mm Hg; P =.046), greater improvement in glycated hemoglobin (–0.35% vs –0.14%; P =.034), and greater improvement in weight (–19.14 lb vs –10.34 lb; P =.0003). The addition of extra support did not have a statistically significant effect on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS For adults with hypertension, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, and overweight or obesity, the VLC diet resulted in greater improvements in systolic blood pressure, glycemic control, and weight over a 4-month period compared with the DASH diet. These findings suggest that larger trials with longer follow-up are warranted to determine whether the VLC diet might be more beneficial for disease management than the DASH diet for these high-risk adults.",10.1370/afm.2968,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: Evidence-based therapies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults with type 2 diabetes are underused in clinical practice. Objective: To assess the effect of a coordinated, multifaceted intervention of assessment, education, and feedback vs usual care on the proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prescribed all 3 groups of recommended, evidence-based therapies (high-intensity statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs]). Design, Setting, and Participants: Cluster randomized clinical trial with 43 US cardiology clinics recruiting participants from July 2019 through May 2022 and follow-up through December 2022. The participants were adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease not already taking all 3 groups of evidence-based therapies. Interventions: Assessing local barriers, developing care pathways, coordinating care, educating clinicians, reporting data back to the clinics, and providing tools for participants (n = 459) vs usual care per practice guidelines (n = 590). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of recommended therapies at 6 to 12 months after enrollment. The secondary outcomes included changes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors and a composite outcome of all-cause death or hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, decompensated heart failure, or urgent revascularization (the trial was not powered to show these differences). Results: Of 1049 participants enrolled (459 at 20 intervention clinics and 590 at 23 usual care clinics), the median age was 70 years and there were 338 women (32.2%), 173 Black participants (16.5%), and 90 Hispanic participants (8.6%). At the last follow-up visit (12 months for 97.3% of participants), those in the intervention group were more likely to be prescribed all 3 therapies (173/457 [37.9%]) vs the usual care group (85/588 [14.5%]), which is a difference of 23.4% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.38 [95% CI, 2.49 to 7.71]; P <.001) and were more likely to be prescribed each of the 3 therapies (change from baseline in high-intensity statins from 66.5% to 70.7% for intervention vs from 58.2% to 56.8% for usual care [adjusted OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.06-2.83]; ACEIs or ARBs: from 75.1% to 81.4% for intervention vs from 69.6% to 68.4% for usual care [adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.14-2.91]; SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1RAs: from 12.3% to 60.4% for intervention vs from 14.5% to 35.5% for usual care [adjusted OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 2.08-4.64]). The intervention was not associated with changes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors. The composite secondary outcome occurred in 23 of 457 participants (5%) in the intervention group vs 40 of 588 participants (6.8%) in the usual care group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.46 to 1.33]).

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background The United States is experiencing a surge in Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections representing a critical need to improve sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and treatment programs. To understand where patients with STIs seek healthcare, we evaluated the relationship between CT infections and the place where individuals report usually receiving healthcare. Methods Our study used a nationally representative sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2016. The study population is adult patients, aged 18 to 39 years in whom a urine CT screen was obtained. Logistic regression models were used to determine if location of usual healthcare was predictive of a positive urine CT screen result. Models were adjusted for known confounders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and insurance status. Results In this nationally representative sample (n = 19,275; weighted n = 85.8 million), 1.9% of individuals had a positive urine CT result. Participants reported usually going to the doctor’s office (70.3%), “no place” (24.8%), Emergency Department (ED) (3.3%), or “other” place (1.7%) for healthcare. In adjusted models, the predicted probability of having a positive urine CT result is higher (4.9% vs 3.2%, p = 0.022; OR = 1.58) among those that reported the ED as their usual place for healthcare compared to those that reported going to a doctor’s office or clinic. Conclusions Individuals having a positive urine CT screen are associated with using the ED as a usual source for healthcare. Understanding this association has the potential to improve STI clinical and policy interventions as the ED may be a critical site in combatting the record high rates of STIs.",10.1371/journal.pone.0251113,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9411-2473,57203971419.0,51271552.0

The primary barriers identified were related to lack of time or energy. Food procurement and preparation practices shifted over time, and DPP was a key influence on current behaviors. Conclusions and Implications: Food agency is complex and manifests heterogeneously in daily life. A life course, contextual, and food agency-based approach could be considered for future diabetes prevention interventions.",10.1016/j.jneb.2023.02.010,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 30 million Americans. Early management focused on blood pressure (BP) control decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Less than 40% of patients with CKD achieve recommended BP targets due to many barriers. These barriers include a lack of understanding of the implications of their diagnosis and how to optimise their health. This cluster randomised control trial hypothesises that the combination of early primary care CKD education, and motivational interviewing (MI)-based health coach support, will improve patient behaviours aligned with BP control by increasing patient knowledge, self-efficacy and motivation. The results will aid in sustainable interventions for future patient-centric education and coaching support to improve quality and outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5. Outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5 receiving the intervention will be compared with similar patients within a control group. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) and systems methodologies will be used to optimise resource neutrality and leverage existing technology to support implementation and future dissemination. The innovative approach of this research focuses on the importance of a multidisciplinary team, including off-site patient coaching, that can intervene early in the CKD care continuum by supporting patients with education and coaching. Methods and analysis We will test impact of BP control when clinician-delivered education is followed by 12 months of MI-based health coaching. We will compare outcomes in 350 patients with CKD stages 3-5 between intervention and control groups in primary care. CQI and systems methodologies will optimise education and coaching for future implementation and dissemination.

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a widely implemented 12-month behavioural weight loss programme for individuals with prediabetes. The DPP covers nutrition but does not explicitly incorporate cooking skills education. The objective of the current study is to describe food and cooking skills (FACS) and strategies of recent DPP participants. Design: Photo-elicitation in-depth interviews were conducted from June to August, 2021. Setting: Baltimore, MD, USA. Participants: Thirteen Black women who participated in DPP. Results: The DPP curriculum influenced participants' healthy cooking practices. Many participants reported shifting from frying foods to air-frying and baking foods to promote healthier cooking and more efficient meal preparation. Participants also reported that their participation in DPP made them more mindful of consuming fruits and vegetables and avoiding foods high in carbohydrates, fats, sugars and Na. With respect to food skills, participants reported that they were more attentive to reading labels and packaging on foods and assessing the quality of ingredients when grocery shopping. Conclusions: Overall, participants reported changing their food preferences, shopping practices and cooking strategies to promote healthier eating after completing the DPP. Incorporating hands-on cooking skills and practices into the DPP curriculum may support sustained behaviour change to manage prediabetes and prevent development of type 2 diabetes among participants.",10.1017/S1368980023001106,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Objective: To assess the effect of a coordinated, multifaceted intervention of assessment, education, and feedback vs usual care on the proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prescribed all 3 groups of recommended, evidence-based therapies (high-intensity statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs]). Design, Setting, and Participants: Cluster randomized clinical trial with 43 US cardiology clinics recruiting participants from July 2019 through May 2022 and follow-up through December 2022. The participants were adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease not already taking all 3 groups of evidence-based therapies. Interventions: Assessing local barriers, developing care pathways, coordinating care, educating clinicians, reporting data back to the clinics, and providing tools for participants (n = 459) vs usual care per practice guidelines (n = 590). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of recommended therapies at 6 to 12 months after enrollment. The secondary outcomes included changes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors and a composite outcome of all-cause death or hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, decompensated heart failure, or urgent revascularization (the trial was not powered to show these differences). Results: Of 1049 participants enrolled (459 at 20 intervention clinics and 590 at 23 usual care clinics), the median age was 70 years and there were 338 women (32.2%), 173 Black participants (16.5%), and 90 Hispanic participants (8.6%). At the last follow-up visit (12 months for 97.3% of participants), those in the intervention group were more likely to be prescribed all 3 therapies (173/457 [37.9%]) vs the usual care group (85/588 [14.5%]), which is a difference of 23.4% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.38 [95% CI, 2.49 to 7.71]; P <.001) and were more likely to be prescribed each of the 3 therapies (change from baseline in high-intensity statins from 66.5% to 70.7% for intervention vs from 58.2% to 56.8% for usual care [adjusted OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.06-2.83]; ACEIs or ARBs: from 75.1% to 81.4% for intervention vs from 69.6% to 68.4% for usual care [adjusted OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.14-2.91]; SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1RAs: from 12.3% to 60.4% for intervention vs from 14.5% to 35.5% for usual care [adjusted OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 2.08-4.64]). The intervention was not associated with changes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors. The composite secondary outcome occurred in 23 of 457 participants (5%) in the intervention group vs 40 of 588 participants (6.8%) in the usual care group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.46 to 1.33]).

This secondary analysis assessed whether intervention success was consistent across sex, race, and ethnicity. METHODS: COORDINATE-Diabetes, a cluster randomized trial, recruited participants from 43 US cardiology clinics (20 randomized to intervention and 23 randomized to usual care). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of evidence-based therapy (high-intensity statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist) at last trial assessment (6 to 12 months). In this prespecified analysis, mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to assess the outcome by self-reported sex, race, and ethnicity in the intervention and usual care groups, with adjustment for baseline characteristics, medications, comorbidities, and site location. RESULTS: Among 1045 participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the median age was 70 years, 32% were female, 16% were Black, and 9% were Hispanic. At the last trial assessment, there was an absolute increase in the proportion of participants prescribed all 3 groups of evidence-based therapy in women (36% versus 15%), Black participants (41% versus 18%), and Hispanic participants (46% versus 18%) with the intervention compared with usual care, with consistent benefit across sex (male versus female; Pinteraction=0.44), race (Black versus White; Pinteraction=0.59), and ethnicity (Hispanic versus Non-Hispanic; Pinteraction= 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The COORDINATE-Diabetes intervention successfully improved delivery of evidence-based care, regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity. Widespread dissemination of this intervention could improve equitable health care quality, particularly among women and minority communities who are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials.

Objectives: (1) Determine the feasibility of a factorial trial testing patient activation and clinician outreach to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk in patients prescribed warfarin–antiplatelet therapy without proton pump inhibitor gastroprotection and (2) assess intervention acceptability. Methods: Pragmatic 2 × 2 factorial cluster-randomized controlled pilot comparing (1) a patient activation booklet vs usual care and (2) clinician notification vs clinician notification plus nurse facilitation was performed. The primary feasibility outcome was percentage of patients completing a structured telephone assessment after 5 weeks. Exploratory outcomes, including effectiveness, were evaluated using chart review, surveys, and semistructured interviews. Results: Among 47 eligible patients, 35/47 (74.5%; 95% CI, 58.6%-85.7%) met the feasibility outcome. In the subset confirmed to be high risk for upper GI bleeding, 11/29 (37.9%; 95% CI, 16.9%-64.7%) made a medication change, without differences between intervention arms. In interviews, few patients reported reviewing the activation booklet; barriers included underestimating GI bleeding risk, misunderstanding the booklet's purpose, and receiving excessive health communication materials. Clinicians responded to notification messages for 24/47 patients (51.1%; 95% CI, 26.4%-75.4%), which was lower for surgeons than nonsurgeons (22.7% vs 76.0%). Medical specialists but not surgeons viewed clinician notification as acceptable.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Morbidity and mortality conference (MMC) is educationally important. However, resident physicians rate it less positively than faculty, citing focus on assigning blame rather than targeting change. Additionally, many MMC presentations are selected for clinical novelty instead of avoidable outcome. Despite significant time and resources routinely committed to MMC, its educational and clinical impact is generally limited. This warrants shifting focus toward quality improvement and systems-based care. METHODS: From July to December 2017, within a large, public academic center and medical school, the family medicine MMC became a quality conference (QC) focusing on thematically-linked, system-based errors. After case presentations, the audience split into small groups for targeted discussion then reconvened to identify specific interventions. We collected attitudinal data from faculty and resident physicians in attendance using real-time audience text polling, targeting case relevance and change impact. RESULTS: Compared to MMC, QC case relevance improved by 0.39 (P<.01) on a 5-point scale. Compared to MMC, QC cumulatively approached but did not meet statistical significance regarding changing clinical practice. Qualitative statements commented on increased multilevel engagement, dedicated follow up, and decreased didactic presentations. CONCLUSIONS: QC demonstrated statistically significant increased relevance compared to MMC, reflecting the benefit of systems-based, thematically-linked cases.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.940516,University of Michigan Medical School,,57189213865.0,

Published by BMJ.Introduction Multiple eating patterns can promote glycaemic control and weight loss among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Clinical practice guidelines for T2D management encourage health professionals to guide patients' selection of a patient-centred eating pattern. This study aims to characterise beliefs about and recommendations for and against practice guideline-concordant eating patterns among registered dietitians (RDs) and other healthcare professionals who provide nutrition counselling to patients with T2D. Methods This was a cross-sectional online survey. We invited 82 RDs affiliated with an academic health system in the midwestern USA to participate. We also invited health professionals who provide nutrition counselling to patients with T2D and are affiliated with 264 primary care practices within the Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes. Participants were asked to select the eating pattern(s) that they commonly recommend or avoid for patients with T2D and why. Results Survey respondents (n=81) most commonly recommend low-carbohydrate (77.8%); Mediterranean-style (52.8%) and energy-modified/calorie-restricted (36.1%) eating patterns. Survey respondents most commonly recommend avoiding very low-carbohydrate (51.0%) and very low-calorie (49.0%) eating patterns. Respondents who did not recommend very low-carbohydrate were most concerned about the eating pattern being too restrictive (93.0%). Conclusions Survey respondents recommend a range of guideline-adherent eating patterns to patients with T2D but tend to recommend against very low-carbohydrate and very low-calorie eating patterns. Additional strategies are needed to increase patient-centred use of these evidence-based options in clinical practice settings.,10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000845,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Data Sources and Study Setting: 2012–2024 VA administrative and survey data. Study Design: This is a summary of findings and impacts from four effectiveness-implementation projects focused on in-person and/or online DPP across VA sites. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Patient demographics, participation data, and key findings and impacts were summarized across reports from the VA Diabetes-Mellitus Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI-DM) Diabetes Prevention Program (VA DPP) Trial, QUERI-DM Online DPP Trial, the Enhancing Mental and Physical Health of Women through Engagement and Retention (EMPOWER) QUERI DPP Project, and EMPOWER 2.0 QUERI Program. Principal Findings: Between 2012 and 2024, four VA QUERI studies enrolled 963 Veterans in DPP across 16 VA sites. All participants had overweight/obesity with one additional risk factor for type 2 diabetes (i.e., prediabetes, elevated risk score, or history of gestational diabetes) and 56% (N = 536) were women. In addition to enhancing the reach of and engagement in diabetes prevention services among Veterans, these projects resulted in three key impacts as follows: (1) informing the national redesign of VA MOVE! including recommendations to increase the number of MOVE! sessions and revise guidelines across 150+ VA sites, (2) enhancing the national evidence base to support online DPP delivery options with citations in national care guidelines outside VA, and (3) demonstrating the importance of gender-tailoring of preventive care services by and for women Veterans to enhance engagement in preventive services. Conclusions: Over the past decade, the evolution of VA QUERI DPP projects increased the reach of and engagement in diabetes prevention services among Veterans, including women Veterans who have been harder to engage in lifestyle change programs in VA, and resulted in three key impacts informing type 2 diabetes and obesity prevention efforts within and outside of VA.",10.1111/1475-6773.14349,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

This article has been contributed to by U.S. Government employees and their work is in the public domain in the USA.Purpose: This secondary exploratory analysis examined rural-urban differences in response to a web-based physical activity self-management intervention for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: Participants with COPD (N = 239 US Veterans) were randomized to either a multicomponent web-based intervention (goal setting, iterative feedback of daily step counts, motivational and educational information, and an online community forum) or waitlist-control for 4 months with a 12-month follow-up. General linear modeling estimated the impact of rural/urban status (using Rural-Urban Commuting Area [RUCA] codes) on (1) 4- and 12-month daily step-count change compared to waitlist-control, and (2) intervention engagement (weekly logons and participant feedback). Findings: Rural (n = 108) and urban (n = 131) participants’ mean age was 66.7±8.8 years. Rural/urban status significantly moderated 4-month change in daily step counts between randomization groups (p = 0.041). Specifically, among urban participants, intervention participants improved by 1500 daily steps more than waitlist-control participants (p = 0.001). There was no difference among rural participants. In the intervention group, rural participants engaged less with the step-count graphs on the website than urban participants at 4 months (p = 0.019); this difference dissipated at 12 months. More frequent logons were associated with greater change in daily step counts (p = 0.004); this association was not moderated by rural/urban status. Conclusions: The web-based intervention was effective for urban, but not rural, participants at 4 months. Rural participants were also less engaged at 4 months, which may explain differences in effectiveness. Technology-based interventions can help address urban-rural disparities in patients with COPD, but may also contribute to them unless resources are available to support engagement with the technology.",10.1111/jrh.12765,Boston University Chobanian &amp; Avedisian School of Medicine,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Only one-third of individuals with T2D receive care as recommended by the American Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines. Effective strategies are needed to accelerate the implementation of guideline concordant T2D care. Methods: The Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D) is a statewide population health collaborative quality initiative (CQI) developed to improve the care of all people with T2D in Michigan. MCT2D has developed a learning health system with physician organizations and their constituent practices to support quality improvement initiatives focused on (1) improving use of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy to improve cardiorenal outcomes, (2) increasing evidence-based use of continuous glucose monitoring, and (3) supporting use of lower carbohydrate eating patterns. Results: Between 2021 and 2022, MCT2D recruited 28 of the 40 Michigan-based physician organizations participating in Blue Cross’ Physician Group Incentive Program with 336 constituent practices and 1357 physicians in primary care (304), endocrinology (21) and nephrology (11). In January 2022, baseline data included a sample of 96,140 unique individuals with T2D. The baseline HbA1c was ≤ 7.0% for 66.3% of patients (n = 32,787), while 14.9% of patients had a most recent HbA1c ≥ 8.0% (n = 7,393). The most recent body mass index (BMI) was ≥ 30.0 for 64.8% of patients (n = 38,516). Discussion: MCT2D has organized a statewide collaborative to recruit and engage a diverse and large set of physician organizations and their constituent practices. This is a promising opportunity to accelerate adoption of guideline-concordant care for people with T2D and may be a model for other state or regional collaboratives. Future directions include specific evidence-based interventions targeted at reducing diabetes-linked comorbidities and associated healthcare costs as well as strategies focused on T2D prevention among at-risk populations.",10.1186/s12913-024-11520-z,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Study design: The intervention was tested in a pragmatic 2-arm RCT. Setting/participants: Participants were adults with prediabetes at three healthcare centers. Intervention: Participants randomized to the enhanced usual care arm received educational materials. Participants in the Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes arm were matched with a peer supporter: another patient who had made healthy lifestyle changes and was trained in autonomy-supportive action planning. Peer supporters were instructed to provide weekly telephone support to their peers on specific action steps toward behavioral goals for 6 months, then monthly support for 6 months. Main outcome measures: Changes in primary outcomes of weight and HbA1c and secondary outcomes of enrollment in formal diabetes prevention programs, self-reported diet, physical activity, health-specific social support, self-efficacy, motivation, and activation at 6 and 12 months were examined. Results: Data collection occurred from October 2018 to March 2022, with analyses completed in September 2022. Among 355 randomized patients, in intention-to-treat analyses, there were no between-group differences in HbA1c or weight changes at 6 and 12 months. Using Peer Support to Aid in Prevention and Treatment in Prediabetes participants were more likely to enroll in structured programs at 6 (AOR=2.45, p=0.009) and 12 (AOR=2.21, p=0.016) months and to report eating whole grains at 6 (4.49, p=0.026) and 12 (4.22, p=0.034) months. They reported greater improvements in perceived social support for diabetes prevention behaviors at 6 (6.39, p<0.001) and 12 (5.48, p<0.001) months, with no differences in other measures. Conclusions: A stand-alone, low-intensity peer support program improved social support and participation in formal diabetes prevention programs but not weight or HbA1c. It will be important to examine whether peer support could effectively complement higher-intensity, structured diabetes prevention programs.

Caroline R. Richardson,Weight Loss Treatment and Longitudinal Weight Change Among Primary Care Patients With Obesity,2024.0,JAMA Network Open,Article,"patients obesity, weight management, weight loss, obesity, obesity wmt, longitudinal weight, obesity prospective, weight change, prevalence obesity","2024 Henderson J et al.IMPORTANCE Among individuals with obesity, 5%or greaterweight loss can improve health. Weight management treatments (WMT) include nutrition counseling, very low-calorie meal replacement (MR), antiobesity medications (AOM), and bariatric surgery; however, little is known about howtheseWMT are associated withweight change among individual patients and populations. OBJECTIVE To characterize weight status and WMT use among primary care patients and assess associations between WMT and weight trajectories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective, population-based cohort study of primary care patients from 1 academic health system in Michigan between October 2015 and March 2020 using cross-sectional analysis to compare obesity prevalence and WMT utilization. For patients with obesity and WMT exposure or matched controls, a multistate Markov model assessing associations between WMT and longitudinal weight status trajectories was used. Data were analyzed from October 2021 to October 2023. EXPOSURES Cross-sectional exposure was year: 2017 or 2019. Trajectory analysis exposures were WMT: nutrition counseling, MR, AOM, and bariatric surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cross-sectional analysis compared mean body mass index (BMI), obesity prevalence, and, among patients with obesity, prospective WMT use. The trajectory analysis examined longitudinal weight status using thresholds of ± 5% and 10% of baseline weight with primary outcomes being the 1-year probabilities of 5%or greater weight loss for each WMT. RESULTS Adult patients (146 959 participants) consisted of 83 636 female participants (56.9%); 8940 (6.1%) were Asian, 14 560 (9.9%) were Black, and 116 664 (79.4%) were White. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 49.6 (17.7) years and mean (SD) BMI of 29.2 (7.2). Among 138 682 patients, prevalence of obesity increased from 39.2%in 2017 to 40.7%in 2019;WMTuse among patients with obesity increased from 5.3%to 7.1% (difference: 1.7%; 95%CI, 1.3%-2.2%). In a multistate model (10 180 patients; 33 549 patient-years), the 1-year probability of 5%or greater weight loss without WMT exposure was 15.6%(95%CI, 14.3%-16.5%) at reference covariates. In contrast, the probability of 5%or greater weight loss was more likely with year-long exposures to any WMT (nutrition counseling: 23.1%; 95%CI, 21.3%-25.1%; MR: 54.6%; 95%CI, 46.5%-61.2%; AOM: 27.8%; 95%CI, 25.0%-30.5%; bariatric surgery: 93.0%; 95%CI, 89.7%-95.0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study of primary-care patients with obesity, all WMT increased the patient-level probability of achieving 5%or greater weight loss, but current rates of utilization are low and insufficient to reduce weight at the population level.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.56183,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1945-6046,7402506038.0,

Traditional grading systems do not accurately assess lesion severity because colposcopic impression alone is unreliable for diagnosis. The likelihood of finding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher increases when two or more cervical biopsies are performed. Excisional and ablative methods have similar treatment outcomes for the eradication of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. However, diagnostic excisional methods, including loop electrosurgical excision procedure and cold knife conization, are associated with an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes, such as preterm labor and low birth weight. Methods of endometrial assessment have a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial carcinoma and benign causes of uterine bleeding without unnecessary procedures. Endometrial biopsy can reliably detect carcinoma involving a large portion of the endometrium, but is suboptimal for diagnosing focal lesions. A 3- to 4-mm cutoff for endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasonography yields the highest sensitivity to exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women. Saline infusion sonohysteroscopy can differentiate globally thickened endometrium amenable to endometrial biopsy from focal abnormalities best assessed by hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy with directed biopsy is the most sensitive and specific method of diagnosing endometrial carcinoma, other than hysterectomy. © 2013 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Michigan Medicine,,29067458200.0,

The 2006 guidelines include recommendations for special populations (i.e., adolescents and pregnant women). Human papillomavirus testing is now included for management of atypical glandular cytology, for follow-up after treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and in combination with cytologic screening in women 30 years and older. The preferred management of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance in adult women is reflex human papillomavirus DNA testing. Colposcopy is recommended for adult women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, atypical glandular cells, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 1 can be managed conservatively in adult women, but treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grades 2 and 3 is recommended. Immediate treatment is an option for adult women but not for adolescents with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Conservative management of adolescents with any cytologic or histologic diagnosis except specified cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ is recommended. Colposcopy is preferred for pregnant women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, but evaluation of the former may be deferred until no earlier than six weeks postpartum. Treatment during pregnancy is unacceptable unless invasive carcinoma is identified. Copyright © 2009 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,29067458200.0,

Methods: In a prospective before-after feeding study, 11 adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73m2 and medication-treated hypertension were provided a reduced-sodium, run-in diet for 1 week followed by a reducedsodium, DASH diet for 2 weeks. Changes in serum electrolytes and BP were compared pre-post DASH. Results: Eleven participants underwent feeding; 1 completed 1 week and 10 completed 2 weeks of DASH. Compared with baseline, DASH modestly increased serum potassium at 1week (mean ± standard deviation, +0.28 ± 0.4 mg/dL; P = 0.043) but had no significant effect on potassium at 2 weeks (+0.15 ± 0.28 mg/dL; P = 0.13). Serum bicarbonate was reduced (?2.5 ± 3.0 mg/dL; P = 0.03) at 2 weeks. Neither incident hyperkalemia nor new onset metabolic acidosis was observed. Clinic BP and mean 24-h ambulatory BP was unchanged. DASH significantly reduced mean nighttime BP (?5.3 ± 5.8 mmHg; P = 0.018), and enhanced percent declines in both nocturnal systolic BP (?2.1% to ?5.1%; P = 0.004) and diastolic BP (?3.7% to ?10.0%; P = 0.008). Conclusions: These pilot data suggest that a reduced-sodium DASH dietary pattern does not cause acute metabolic events in adults with moderate CKD andmay improve nocturnal BP. Definitive studies are needed to determine long-term effects of DASH in CKD.",10.1093/ckj/sfw046,Duke University School of Medicine, 0009-0001-6798-576X,57210892659.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Morbidity and mortality conference (MMC) is educationally important. However, resident physicians rate it less positively than faculty, citing focus on assigning blame rather than targeting change. Additionally, many MMC presentations are selected for clinical novelty instead of avoidable outcome. Despite significant time and resources routinely committed to MMC, its educational and clinical impact is generally limited. This warrants shifting focus toward quality improvement and systems-based care. METHODS: From July to December 2017, within a large, public academic center and medical school, the family medicine MMC became a quality conference (QC) focusing on thematically-linked, system-based errors. After case presentations, the audience split into small groups for targeted discussion then reconvened to identify specific interventions. We collected attitudinal data from faculty and resident physicians in attendance using real-time audience text polling, targeting case relevance and change impact. RESULTS: Compared to MMC, QC case relevance improved by 0.39 (P<.01) on a 5-point scale. Compared to MMC, QC cumulatively approached but did not meet statistical significance regarding changing clinical practice. Qualitative statements commented on increased multilevel engagement, dedicated follow up, and decreased didactic presentations. CONCLUSIONS: QC demonstrated statistically significant increased relevance compared to MMC, reflecting the benefit of systems-based, thematically-linked cases.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.940516,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1945-6046,57189213865.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE: To test a pilot home-telehealth program to enhance functional ability, physical performance, and objective physical activity in Veterans after hospital discharge. METHOD: A physical activity trainer and multidisciplinary team supported the progression of rehabilitation goals via a 6-month home exercise program. Pilot program feasibility, including recruitment, retention, reasons for early withdrawal, differences between those who did and did not complete the program, and completion of outcome measures are reported. Outcomes include changes in functional ability, physical performance, and physical activity (using actigraphy) from baseline to endpoint. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 45 Veterans enrolled did not complete the 6-month program. No baseline differences were found comparing completers and non-completers. The majority of completers (n = 24) were White men with a mean age of 74 years (SD = 8 years, range = 64 to 93 years) and included those with no (n = 8), mild (n = 13), and moderate (n = 3) cognitive impairment. Although there were borderline improvements in functional ability and physical performance from baseline to endpoint, mean steps per day increased from 2,206 (SD = 1,780) to 3,888 (SD = 2,895) (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The pilot home-telehealth program is feasible and may address declines in function and activity observed during hospital-to-home transitions, including among those with cognitive impair-ment.

Objectives: To determine if chest computed tomography (CT)-assessed functional small airway would increase with age, even among asymptomatic individuals. Methods: We used parametric response mapping analysis of paired inspiratory/expiratory CTs to identify functional small airway abnormality (PRMFSA) and emphysema (PRMEMPH) in the SPIROMICS (Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study) cohort. Using adjusted linear regression models, we analyzed associations between PRMFSA and age in subjects with or without airflow obstruction. We subdivided participants with normal spirometry based on respiratory-related impairment (6-minute-walk distance <350 m, modified Medical Research Council ≥2, chronic bronchitis, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire >25, respiratory events requiring treatment [antibiotics and/or steroids or hospitalization] in the year before enrollment). Measurements and Main Results: Among 580 never- and ever-smokers without obstruction or respiratory impairment, PRMFSA increased 2.7% per decade, ranging from 3.6% (ages 40-50 yr) to 12.7% (ages 70-80 yr). PRMEMPH increased nonsignificantly (0.1% [ages 40-50 yr] to 0.4% [ages 70-80 yr]; P = 0.34). Associations were similar among nonobstructed individuals with respiratory-related impairment. Increasing PRMFSA in subjects without airflow obstruction was associated with increased FVC (P = 0.004) but unchanged FEV1 (P = 0.94), yielding lower FEV1/FVC ratios (P < 0.001). Although emphysema was also significantly associated with lower FEV1/FVC (P = 0.04), its contribution relative to PRMFSA in those without airflow obstruction was limited by its low burden. Conclusions: In never- and ever-smokers without airflow obstruction, aging is associated with increased FVC and CT-defined functional small airway abnormality regardless of respiratory symptoms.",10.1164/rccm.201604-0871OC,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,10240446500.0,

Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.OBJECTIVE: Younger persons with COPD report worse health-related quality of life (HRQL) than do older individuals. The factors explaining these differences remain unclear. The objective of this article was to explore factors associated with age-related differences in HRQL in COPD. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of participants with COPD, any Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grade of airflow limitation, and ≥ 50 years old in two cohorts: the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study and the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We compared St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores by age group: middle-aged (age, 50-64) vs older (age, 65-80) adults. We used multivariate linear modeling to test associations of age with HRQL, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 4,097 participants in the COPD Gene study (2,170 middle-aged and 1,927 older adults) SGRQ total scores were higher (worse) among middle-aged (mean difference, -4.2 points; 95% CI, -5.7 to -2.6; P < .001) than older adults. Age had a statistically significant interaction with dyspnea (P < .001). Greater dyspnea severity (modified Medical Research Council ≥ 2, compared with 0-1) had a stronger association with SGRQ score among middle-aged (β, 24.6; 95% CI, 23.2-25.9) than older-adult (b, 21.0; 95% CI, 19.6-22.3) participants. In analyses using SGRQ as outcome in 1,522 participants in SPIROMICS (598 middle-aged and 924 older adults), we found similar associations, confirming that for the same severity of dyspnea there is a stronger association with HRQL among younger individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related differences in HRQL may be explained by a higher impact of dyspnea among younger subjects with COPD.",10.1016/j.chest.2015.11.025,A.

All rights reserved.Importance: Older adults vary widely in age at diagnosis and duration of type 2 diabetes, but treatment often ignores this heterogeneity. Objectives: To investigate the associations of diabetes vs no diabetes, age at diagnosis, and diabetes duration with negative health outcomes in people 50 years and older. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included participants in the 1995 through 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-based, biennial longitudinal health interview survey of older adults in the US. The study sample included adults 50 years or older (n = 36060) without diabetes at entry. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022. Exposures: The presence of diabetes, specifically the age at diabetes diagnosis, was the main exposure of the study. Age at diagnosis was defined as the age when the respondent first reported diabetes. Adults who developed diabetes were classified into 3 age-at-diagnosis groups: 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 70 years and older. Main Outcomes and Measures: For each diabetes age-at-diagnosis group, a propensity score-matched control group of respondents who never developed diabetes was constructed. The association of diabetes with the incidence of key outcomes - including heart disease, stroke, disability, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality - was estimated and the association of diabetes vs no diabetes among the age-at-diagnosis case and matched control groups was compared. Results: A total of 7739 HRS respondents developed diabetes and were included in the analysis (4267 women [55.1%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 67.4 [9.9] years). The age-at-diagnosis groups included 1866 respondents at 50 to 59 years, 2834 at 60 to 69 years, and 3039 at 70 years or older; 28321 HRS respondents never developed diabetes. Age at diagnosis of 50 to 59 years was significantly associated with incident heart disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66 [95% CI, 1.40-1.96]), stroke (HR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.30-2.07]), disability (HR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.59-2.72]), cognitive impairment (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.05-1.61]), and mortality (HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.29-1.71]) compared with matched controls, even when accounting for diabetes duration. These associations significantly decreased with advancing age at diagnosis. Respondents with diabetes diagnosed at 70 years or older only showed a significant association with the outcome of elevated mortality (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.17]). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that age at diabetes diagnosis was differentially associated with outcomes and that younger age groups were at elevated risk of heart disease, stroke, disability, cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality. These findings reinforce the clinical heterogeneity of diabetes and highlight the importance of improving diabetes management in adults with earlier diagnosis..",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.32766,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,,10240446500.0,

Method: Longitudinal 8-year data from 1,381 Japanese adults aged 65 years or above were analyzed using hierarchical linear models, stratified according to gender. Results: GS declined following a linear trajectory. In both genders, higher BF% was associated with weaker GS, but not with the rate of decline. GS trajectory did not correlate with baseline TG, HDL-C, or HbA1c. Cardiometabolic factors mediated educational differences in GS intercept in both genders. In women, better SRH predicted stronger GS. The effect of SRH was robust to adjustments for cardiometabolic risk.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.Objective: Electronic health records (EHRs) have become a common data source for clinical risk prediction, offering large sample sizes and frequently sampled metrics. There may be notable differences between hospital-based EHR and traditional cohort samples: EHR data often are not population-representative random samples, even for particular diseases, as they tend to be sicker with higher healthcare utilization, while cohort studies often sample healthier subjects who typically are more likely to participate. We investigate heterogeneities between EHR- and cohort-based inferences including incidence rates, risk factor identifications/quantifications, and absolute risks. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of older patients with type 2 diabetes using EHR from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care (NYULH-EHR, years 2009-2017) and from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS, 1995-2014) to study subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. We used the same eligibility criteria, outcome definitions, and demographic covariates/biomarkers in both datasets. We compared subsequent CVD incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs) of risk factors, and discrimination/calibration performances of CVD risk scores. Results: The estimated subsequent total CVD incidence rate was 37.5 and 90.6 per 1000 person-years since T2DM onset in HRS and NYULH-EHR respectively. HR estimates were comparable between the datasets for most demographic covariates/biomarkers. Common CVD risk scores underestimated observed total CVD risks in NYULH-EHR. Discussion and conclusion: EHR-estimated HRs of demographic and major clinical risk factors for CVD were mostly consistent with the estimates from a national cohort, despite high incidences and absolute risks of total CVD outcome in the EHR samples.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa059,NYU Langone Health,,10240446500.0,5884039.0

Aims: The objective of thids study is to evaluate the contribution of cognitive function to repeat falls in older PAC Veterans. Methods: Data were collected from medical records for 91 single and 30 repeat fallers over 5 consecutive years (2011–2016). Results: After controlling for demographic and medical factors, lower Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score was associated with increased odds of repeat falls. MMSE scores below 20 (with age held constant at the mean) were associated with a greater than 50% chance of a repeat fall (compared to 24.7% base rate). Admission for a neurologic reason further increased risk. Discussion: PAC Veterans who experience a fall have an increased risk of repeat falls with concomitant cognitive dysfunction and/or admission for neurologic reasons. Conclusions: Results support tailoring multi-component interventions for those with cognitive dysfunction utilizing standardized mental status screening upon admission.",10.1007/s40520-020-01635-8,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,,10240446500.0,5884039.0

We report the challenges and successes of our efforts to: 1) assemble a new multipayer (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial) claims dataset linked to a clinical registry and 2) use the new dataset to perform comparative effectiveness research on implementation of the 2 SMS models.STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study.METHODS: We lost permission to use private-payer data. Therefore, we used claims from Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare/Medicaid dual-eligible patients merged with chronic disease registry data. We studied 2008 to 2010, which included 1 year pre- and 1 year post the 2009 implementation time period. Outcomes were outpatient and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, care process (use of statin), and 3 intermediate outcomes (glycemic control, blood pressure [BP], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]).RESULTS: In our sample of 2826 patients, quality of care improved and utilization decreased over the 2.5 years. Both approaches improved lipid control (LDL-C decreased by an average of 4 mg/dL for pharmacy-SMS and 5.6 mg/dL for nurse-SMS) and diastolic BP (-1.5 mm Hg for pharmacy-SMS and -1.3 mm Hg for nurse-SMS), whereas only the pharmacy-led approach decreased primary care visits (by 0.8 visits). The groups differed slightly on 2 measures (glycated hemoglobin, systolic BP) with respect to the trajectory of improvement over time, but performance was similar by 2.5 years.CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes care improved during PCMH implementation systemwide, supporting both nurse-led and pharmacist-led SMS models.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,10240446500.0,

All rights reserved.Background:Respondents in longitudinal health interview surveys may inconsistently report their chronic diseases across interview waves. Racial/ethnic minority adults have an increased burden of chronic diseases and may dispute chronic disease reports more frequently.Objective:We evaluated the longitudinal association between race/ethnicity, nativity, and language of interview with disputing previously reported chronic diseases.Methods:We performed secondary data analysis of nationally representative longitudinal data (Health and Retirement Study, 1998-2010) of adults 51 years or older (n=23,593). We estimated multilevel mixed-effects logistic models of disputes of previously reported chronic disease (hypertension, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, arthritis).Results:Approximately 22% of Health and Retirement Study respondents disputed prior chronic disease self-reports across the entire study period; 21% of non-Latino white, 20.5% of non-Latino black, and 28% of Latino respondents disputed. In subgroup comparisons of model-predicted odds using postestimation commands, Latinos interviewed in Spanish have 34% greater odds of disputing compared with non-Latino whites interviewed in English and 35% greater odds of dispute relative to non-Latino blacks interviewed in English.Conclusions:The odds of disputing a prior chronic disease report were substantially higher for Latinos who were interviewed in Spanish compared with non-Latino white or black counterparts interviewed in English, even after accounting for other sociodemographic factors, cognitive declines, and time-in-sample considerations. Our findings point toward leveraging of multiple sources of data to triangulate information on chronic disease status as well as investigating potential mechanisms underlying the higher probability of dispute among Spanish-speaking Latino respondents.",10.1097/MLR.0000000000001148,OHSU-PSU School of Public Health,,10240446500.0,

Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries in file years 1999–2007. Participants: Individuals aged 65 and older in the Medicare Beneficiary Survey who had data available for at least 1 year after index interview (N = 14,052). Measurements: Surveys (self-report) were used to assess chronic conditions, and latent class analysis (LCA) was used to define multimorbidity classes based on the presence or absence of 13 conditions. All participants were assigned to a best-fit class. Primary outcomes were hospitalizations and emergency department visits over 1 year. Results: The primary LCA identified six classes. The largest portion of participants (32.7%) was assigned to the minimal disease class, in which most persons had fewer than two of the conditions. The other five classes represented various degrees and patterns of multimorbidity. Usage rates were higher in classes with greater morbidity, but many individuals could not be assigned to a particular class with confidence (sample misclassification error estimate = 0.36). Number of conditions predicted outcomes at least as well as class membership. Conclusion: Although recognition of general patterns of disease co-occurrence is useful for policy planning, the heterogeneity of persons with significant multimorbidity (≥3 conditions) defies neat classification.

These data may be limited by inconsistencies in self-report by respondents across waves. We examined disease inconsistencies in the Health and Retirement Study and investigated a multistep method of adjudication. We hypothesized a greater likelihood of inconsistences among respondents with cognitive impairment, of underrepresented race/ethnic groups, having lower education, or having less income/wealth. Method We analyzed Waves 1995-2010, including adults 51 years and older (N = 24,156). Diseases included hypertension, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and arthritis. We used questions about the diseases to formulate a multistep adjudication method to resolve inconsistencies across waves. Results Thirty percent had inconsistency in their self-report of diseases across waves, with cognitive impairment, proxy status, age, Hispanic ethnicity, and wealth as key predictors. Arthritis and hypertension had the most frequent inconsistencies; stroke and cancer, the fewest. Using a stepwise method, we adjudicated 60%-75% of inconsistent responses. Discussion Discrepancies in the self-report of diseases across multiple waves of health interview surveys are common. Differences in prevalence between original and adjudicated data may be substantial for some diseases and for some groups, (e.g., the cognitively impaired).",10.1093/geronb/gbw063,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,,10240446500.0,

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Health care delivery for older adults can be accomplished optimally via an effective and coordinated interdisciplinary team. Integrating neuropsychological services into clinics that are common referral sources, and share overlapping clinical and educational opportunities, can offer advantages to treatment delivery and provide a unique value to patients and health care teams. Research demonstrating such clinic models has been limited to nonspecialty settings (e.g., Primary Care) and can lack specific frameworks from which fully integrative services can be achieved and generalized. Herein we describe the development and implementation of neuropsychological assessment and intervention services into a Geriatric Medicine clinic at the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS) utilizing the Primary Care Behavioral Health model (PCBH). Method: A case illustration demonstrates the utilization of integrative neuropsychology assessment and intervention services. Results: The benefits of service colocation, as well as the potential to increase patient access and improve communication and education within an interdisciplinary team, are discussed.

Christine Cigolle,Multiple Chronic Conditions Explain Ethnic Differences in Functional Outcome among Patients with Ischemic Stroke,2022.0,Stroke,Article,Comorbidity; Ethnic groups; Multiple chronic conditions; Prognosis; Stroke; Comorbidity; Ethnic groups; Multiple chronic conditions; Prognosis; Stroke,"2021 American Heart Association, Inc.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mexican Americans (MAs) have worse stroke outcomes and a different profile of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) compared with non-Hispanic White people. MCC has implications for stroke treatment, complications, and poststroke care, which impact poststroke functional outcome (FO). We sought to assess the contribution of MCC to the ethnic difference in FO at 90 days between MAs and non-Hispanic White people. METHODS: In a prospective cohort of ischemic stroke patients (2008-2016) from Nueces County, Texas, data were collected from patient interviews, medical records, and hospital discharge data. MCC was assessed using a stroke-specific and function-relevant index (range, 0-35; higher scores greater MCC burden). Poststroke FO was measured by an average score of 22 activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs at 90 days (range, 1-4; higher scores worse FO). The contribution of MCC to the ethnic difference in FO was assessed using Tobit regression. Effect modification by ethnicity was examined. RESULTS: Among the 896 patients, 70% were MA and 51% were women. Mean age was 68±12.2 years; 33% of patients were dependent in ADL/instrumental ADLs (FO score >3, representing a lot of difficulty with ADL/instrumental ADLs) at 90 days. MAs had significantly higher age-adjusted MCC burden compared with non-Hispanic White people. Patients with high MCC score (at the 75th percentile) on average scored 0.70 points higher in the FO score (indicating worse FO) compared with those with low MCC score (at the 25th percentile) after adjusting for age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and sociodemographic factors. MCC explained 19% of the ethnic difference in FO, while effect modification by ethnicity was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: MAs had a higher age-adjusted MCC burden, which partially explained the ethnic difference in FO. The prevention and treatment of MCC could potentially mitigate poststroke functional impairment and lessen ethnic disparities in stroke outcomes.",10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.032595,Department of Epidemiology,,10240446500.0,

Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.Background: Multiple chronic conditions (MCC) contribute to functional disability in the general population although its role in predicting functional outcome (FO) among patients with stroke is not well understood. There is no universal agreement on the approach to measuring MCC in stroke, and findings have been mixed regarding MCC being an independent predictor for poststroke FO. Objectives: This review aims to summarize the findings of studies that have investigated the relationship between MCC and FO after ischemic stroke using a MCC index. Method: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for studies conducted among ischemic stroke patients that have examined the adjusted association between prestroke MCC and FO. The quality of the included studies was appraised using a risk of bias (RoB) assessment checklist. A meta-analysis was performed for the association between MCC and FO using a random effects model to estimate the overall pooled ORs. Results: Twelve of the 18 studies included were hospital-based cohort studies, with a median RoB score of 4.75 points (range 1-9, higher scores for higher RoB). Studies predominantly used the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), or the Modified CCI to measure MCC burden, and the modified Rankin scale to measure FO. Half of the studies reported a significant negative association between MCC and FO, which was also found by the meta-analysis with a pooled OR of 1.11 (95% CI 1.05-1.18). Conclusions: The current review supports that increased MCC is associated with worse poststroke FO although population-based studies of this association are lacking. Future research should aim to develop more refined measures of MCC that consider the severity and interactions of comorbid conditions reflective of the broader stroke population and to understand the relationship between MCC and poststroke FO with thorough adjustment for confounding factors.",10.1159/000503900,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,10240446500.0,5884039.0
Christine Cigolle,New Index for Multiple Chronic Conditions Predicts Functional Outcome in Ischemic Stroke,2021.0,Neurology,Article,Stroke; Stroke,"2020 American Academy of Neurology.Objective: To determine whether a new index for multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) predicts poststroke functional outcome (FO), we developed and internally validated the new MCC index in patients with ischemic stroke. Methods: A prospective cohort of patients with ischemic stroke (2008-2017) was interviewed at baseline and 90 days in the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project. An average of 22 activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) items measured the FO score (range 1-4) at 90 days. A FO score >3 (representing a lot of difficulty with ADL/IADLs) was considered unfavorable FO. A new index was developed using machine learning techniques to select and weight conditions and prestroke impairments. Results: Prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, age, congestive heart failure (CHF), weight loss, diabetes, other neurologic disorders, and synergistic effects (dementia × age, CHF × renal failure, and prestroke mRS × prior stroke/TIA) were identified as important predictors in the MCC index. In the validation dataset, the index alone explained 31% of the variability in the FO score, was well-calibrated (p = 0.41), predicted unfavorable FO well (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81), and outperformed the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index in predicting the FO score and poststroke mRS. Conclusion: sA new MCC index was developed and internally validated to improve the prediction of poststroke FO. Novel predictors and synergistic interactions were identified. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with ischemic stroke, an index for MCC predicts FO at 90 days.",10.1212/WNL.0000000000010992,Department of Epidemiology,,10240446500.0,5884039.0

While modern ethicists have largely reached the conclusion that full disclosure of dementia serves the best interest of patient, the implications of disclosure of a dementia diagnosis remains an underexplored area of research in Japan. The purpose of this study was to explore primary care physicians' perspectives relative to the practice of disclosure of the dementia diagnosis. Methods: In this qualitatively driven mixed methods project, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 primary care physicians using purposeful sampling to identify rural and urban representation. All interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. The research team iteratively conducted discussions of the concepts as they emerged until reaching thematic saturation. The summary was distributed to the participants for member checking and we incorporated their feedback into the final analysis. Results: Of 24 participants, 12 practice in rural areas and 12 practice in urban/suburban areas. Participants' attitudes varied in whether or not to disclose dementia diagnosis to the patients, and in the level of clarity of the name and the prognosis of the disease. Participants who were more comfortable in practicing disclosure were communicating collectively to the patients and their family members and those who were less comfortable practicing disclosure were concerned about patients' feelings and had negative perceptions given the insidious progression of the disease. Conclusion: We found substantive individual differences in the approach to disclosure of the diagnosis of dementia and the level of comfort among primary care physicians. More dialogue about this issue and training to equip primary care physicians lacking confidence in their approach may be required.",10.1186/s12875-019-0964-1,Hamamatsu University School of Medicine,,10240446500.0,

Methods: Qualitative research was conducted in an ethnographic tradition using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis in primary care settings across Japan and in the Midwest State of Michigan, US. Participants were a total of 48 primary care physicians, 24 each from Japan and the US participated. Both groups contained a mixture of geographic areas (rural/urban), gender, age, and years of experience as primary care physicians. Results: Participants in Japan and the US voiced similar practices for making the diagnosis of dementia and held similar views about the desired benefits of diagnosing dementia. Differences were found in attitudes about the appropriate timing of formally diagnosing dementia. Japanese physicians tended to make a formal diagnosis when problems that would benefit from long-term care services emerged for family members. US physicians were more proactive in diagnosing dementia in the early stages by screening for dementia in health check-ups and promoting advance directives when the patients were still capable of decision-making. Views about appropriate timing of diagnostic testing for dementia in the two systems reflect what medical or nursing care services physicians can use to support dementia patients and caregivers. Conclusions: Benefits of making the diagnosis included the need to activate the long-term care services in Japan and for early intervention and authoring advance directives in the US.

This study aimed to elucidate the approaches of primary care physicians in Japan and the United States (US) in managing multimorbidity for patients with dementia and discuss the challenges involved. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted through one-on-one semi-structured interviews among primary care physicians, 24 each from Japan and Michigan, US. Thematic and content analyses were performed to explore similarities and differences among each country’s data. Results: Primary care physicians in Japan and Michigan applied a relaxed adherence to the guidelines for patients’ chronic conditions. Common challenges were the suboptimal consultation time, the insufficient number or ability of care-coordinating professionals, patients’ conditions such as difficulties with self-management, living alone, behavioral issues, and refusal of care support. Unique challenges in Japan were free-access medical systems and not being sure about the patients’ will in end-of-life care. In Michigan, physicians faced challenges in distance and lack of transportation between clinics and patients’ homes and in cases where patients lacked the financial ability to acquire good care. Conclusions: To improve the quality of care for patients with multimorbidity and dementia, physicians would benefit from optimal time and compensation allocated for this patient group, guidelines for chronic conditions to include information regarding changing priority for older adults with dementia, and the close collaboration of medical and social care and community resources with support of skilled care-coordinating professionals.",10.1186/s12875-023-02088-4,Omaezaki Family Medicine Center,,10240446500.0,5884039.0

Christine Cigolle,Team VA Video Connect (VVC) to optimize mobility and physical activity in post-hospital discharge older veterans: baseline assessment,2021.0,BMC Geriatrics,Article,Tea; Tea,"2021, The Author(s).Background: Telehealth is increasingly used for rehabilitation and exercise but few studies include older adult participants with comorbidities and impairment, particularly cognitive. Using Veterans Administration Video Connect (VVC), the aim of the present study is to present the screening, recruitment, baseline assessment, and initial telehealth utilization of post-hospital discharge Veterans in a VVC home-telehealth based program to enhance mobility and physical activity. Methods: Older adult Veterans (n = 45, mean age 73), recently discharged from the hospital with physical therapy goals, were VVC-assessed in self-report and performance-based measures, using test adaptations as necessary, by a clinical pharmacy specialist and social worker team. Results: Basic and instrumental ADL disabilities were common as were low mobility (Short Portable Performance Battery) and physical activity levels (measured by actigraphy). Half had Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in the mild cognitive impairment range (< 24). Over 2/3 of the participants used VA-supplied tablets. While half of the Veterans were fully successful in VVC, 1/3 of these and an additional group with at least one failed connection requested in-person visits for assistance. One-quarter had no VVC success and sought help for tablet troubleshooting, and half of these eventually “gave up” trying to connect; difficulty with using the computer and physical impairment (particularly dexterity) were described prominently in this group. On the other hand, Veterans with at least mild cognitive impairment (based on MoCA scores) were present in all connectivity groups and most of these used caregiver support to facilitate VVC. Conclusions: Disabled older post-hospital discharged Veterans with physical therapy goals can be VVC-assessed and enrolled into a mobility/physical activity intervention. A substantial proportion required technical support, including in-person support for many. Yet, VVC seems feasible in those with mild cognitive impairment, assuming the presence of an able caregiver. Modifications of assessment tools were needed for the VVC interface, and while appearing feasible, will require further study.

Methods: This retrospective medical record review/abstraction analyzed (from March 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022) data from US veteran participants in a pilot implementation (April 13, 2021, to May 20, 2022) of the Telepharmacy Model of Care at the Veterans Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System (Ann Arbor, Michigan). The project team assessed and made recommendations about multiple factors in medication management: medication list accuracy; safety of medications and their combinations; older adults' cognition, health literacy, and physical abilities and impairments in self-managing medications; and caregivers' ability to compensate for those impairments. Findings: The pilot included 60 US veterans (mean age, 75 years [range, 59–93 years]; 97% were men). Overall, participants were successful in using telemedicine (98%). Encounters required 30 to 45 minutes for the visit and 20 minutes for follow-up and documentation (P = 0.14 pharmacist vs pharmacy technician). The median number of medications per patient was 18. A total of 57% of patients had four or more medication-related discrepancies; fewer patients experienced medication-adherence problems, drug–drug interactions, problematic medication combinations, and untreated/undertreated conditions. Using the Safe Medication Algorithm for Older Adults tool, 35% were identified as taking a Red Flag medication (contraindicated in older adults), and 74%, a High Risk medication (eg, an anticoagulant). A total of 37% had cognitive and health literacy impairments, and 45%, physical impairments, interfering with the ability to self-manage medications. Recommendations on deprescribing were made in 98% of patients. Implication: The telemedicine-based and pharmacist/pharmacy technician–delivered model was a feasible method for addressing comprehensive medication review and deprescribing in these cognitively and functionally impaired US veterans.",10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.08.009,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,,10240446500.0,

Materials and Methods: All outpatient encounters (n = 12 143 456) for Veterans (n = 4 373 638) that had VA PCLIPVs during the period of observation were categorized as conducted by VT2H, in-person, or telephone. The change over time in the percentage of total PCLIPVs conducted by VT2H was plotted and associations between VA station characteristics and VT2H usage were analyzed using simple statistics and negative binomial regression. Results: Between March 2020 and mid-August 2020, VT2H visits increased from <2% to 13% of all VA PCLIPVs. However, VT2H usage varied substantively by VA station and declined system-wide to <9% of PCLIPVs by July 2021. VA stations that serve a greater proportion of rural Veterans were found less likely to use VT2H. Discussion: The VA was successful in increasing the use of VT2H for PCLIPVs during the first phase of the COVID pandemic. However, VT2H usage varied by VA station and over time. Beyond rurality, it is unknown what station characteristics may be responsible for the variance in VT2H use. Conclusion: Future investigation is warranted to identify the unique practices employed by VA stations that were most successful in using VT2H for PCLIPVs and whether they can be effectively disseminated to other stations.",10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad075,Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center,,10240446500.0,

Angioedema (AE) is a common condition which can be complicated by laryngeal edema, having up to 40% mortality. Although sporadic case reports attest to the benefits of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in treating severe acute bouts of AE, little evidence-based support for this practice is available at present. Study Objectives. To compare the frequency, duration of intubation, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay in patients with acute airway AE, with and without the use of FFP. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, investigating adults admitted to large community hospital ICU with a diagnosis of AE during the years of 2007-2012. Altogether, 128 charts were reviewed for demographics, comorbidities, hospital courses, and outcomes. A total of 20 patients received FFP (108 did not). Results. Demographics and comorbidities did not differ by treatment group. However, nontreated controls did worse in terms of intubation frequency (60% versus 35%; p = 0.05) and ICU stay (3.5 days versus 1.5 days; p < 0.001). Group outcomes were otherwise similar. Conclusion. In an emergency department setting, the use of FFP should be considered in managing acute airway nonhereditary AE (refractory to steroid, antihistamine, and epinephrine). Larger prospective, better controlled studies are needed to devise appropriate treatment guidelines.",10.1155/2016/6091510,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,,10240446500.0,

This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The American Geriatrics Society.Background: The purpose of this project was to measure satisfaction with virtual comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGA) among older Veterans (OVs). Methods: The CGA involved five different healthcare providers and four one-hour VA Video Connect (VVC) calls. Using specific enrollment criteria, OVs were recruited in four cohorts separated by time. After completing the CGA, participants were asked to complete a 10-statement telephone questionnaire. Before analyses, responses to each statement were dichotomized as Agree (Agree/Strongly agree) or Do not Agree (Neutral/Disagree/Strongly Disagree). Descriptive statistics and Binomial generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyze the data. Results: All 269 enrolled OVs completed all components of the CGA. This included 79, 57, 61, and 72 Veterans in cohorts 1 to 4, respectively. Their average age was 76.0 ± 5.9 years, and they were predominately white (82%), male (94%), and residents of rural settings (64%). Of the 236 (88%) OVs who completed the telephone survey, 57% indicated they were comfortable using VVC and 57% expressed willingness to use VVC again; 44% felt that VVC was easier than going to in-person visits. The OVs in Cohort 1 were more likely to agree with these statements than those in the remaining cohorts, especially Cohorts 2 and 4. Differences in demographics partially explained some of these findings. The majority (89% or higher) of survey participants agreed with the remaining seven survey statements indicating they were satisfied with the CGA program. Conclusion: OVs were very satisfied with their participation in a program of CGA, although not necessarily the mode of delivery. The percentage of participants who indicated discomfort using VVC for the CGA visits appeared to increase with time. Further work is needed to determine which OVs would be the best candidates to use VVC to complete all or part of a CGA.",10.1111/jgs.19204,Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center,,10240446500.0,

We examined the hazard ratio for ADRD after incident TSCI and hypothesized that ADRD hazard is greater among adults with incident TSCI compared with their matched control of adults without TSCI. Setting: Using 2010–2020 U.S. national private administrative claims data, we identified adults aged 45 years and older with probable (likely and highly likely) incident TSCI (n = 657). Our controls included one-to-ten matched cohort of people without TSCI (n = 6553). Methods: We applied Cox survival models and adjusted them for age, sex, years of living with certain chronic conditions, exposure to six classes of prescribed medications, and neighborhood characteristics of place of residence. Hazard ratios were used to compare the results within a 4-year follow-up. Results: Our fully adjusted model without any interaction showed that incident TSCI increased the risk for ADRD (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01–1.67). People aged 45–64 with incident TSCI were at high risk for ADRD (HR = 5.14; 95% CI, 2.27–11.67) and no significant risk after age 65 (HR = 1.20; 95% CI,.92–1.55). Our sensitivity analyses confirmed a higher hazard ratio for ADRD after incident TSCI at 45–64 years of age compared with the matched controls. Conclusions: TSCI is associated with a higher hazard of ADRD. This study informs the need to update clinical guidelines for cognitive screening after TSCI to address the heightened risk of cognitive decline and to shed light on the causality between TSCI and ADRD.",10.1038/s41393-024-01009-1,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,10240446500.0,

Christine Jean Medaugh,Assessment of specific risks for the recurrence of deep vein thrombosis: A case report,2009.0,Cases Journal,Article,"thrombosis consequent, risks recurrence, venous thromboembolism, thrombosis case, thrombosis, anticoagulation warfarin, deep vein, vein thrombosis, coumadin thrombophilia","Introduction: Venous thromboembolism is a multifactorial disease defined by multiple interactions between genetic and environmental components. It is managed by oral anticoagulation with warfarin sodium (Coumadin), a drug that targets the vitamin K epoxide reductase to prevent the recycling of vitamin K epoxide to the reduced form of vitamin K. The reduced form of vitamin K is an essential cofactor in the formation of active clotting factors II, VII, IX, X and regulatory factors protein C, and cofactor protein S through gamma-glutamyl carboxylation. The duration of Coumadin treatment, three to six months or life-long, should be based on the individual risk for recurrent deep vein thrombosis and on the associated increased risk for bleeding complications. Case Presentation: A previously healthy 50-year-old white male developed a deep vein thrombosis consequent to surgical placement of a titanium rod to correct a fracture of the femur and he was maintained for over a year on daily oral doses of Coumadin 9 mg and aspirin 325 mg. When he began to bruise spontaneously with multiple large hematomas appearing without provocation, he requested that his primary care physician reconsider the anticoagulation. Because of his age, sex, and the possibility of an inherited or acquired anticoagulant protein deficiency he was maintained on Coumadin and a thrombophilia work up was ordered. Test results were interpreted as deficiencies in both protein C and protein S and he was instructed that life-long therapy with Coumadin was necessary. Is this a correct evaluation by his primary care physician? Conclusion: This case illustrates that Coumadin, a vitamin K agonist, was exerting a therapeutically acceptable negative influence on plasma activity levels of vitamin K-dependent protein C and protein S. Relying on the outcome of a thrombophilia work-up for a decision to maintain or cease Coumadin treatment of patients at risk for recurrent deep vein thrombosis has pitfalls that can be avoided. The use of real-time B-mode venous ultrasonography to verify complete restoration of venous flow before ceasing Coumadin treatment is not always considered in the long-term management of a patient with a first thrombosis, despite the well documented significant risk of deep vein thrombosis recurrence associated with an unresolved thrombosis. © 2009 Boys et al.; licensee Cases Network Ltd.",10.4076/1757-1626-2-7024,MSU College of Human Medicine,,36114016500.0,

This study aimed to characterize guideline-discordant aspirin use among adults in a community care setting. As part of a quality improvement initiative, patients at 1 internal medicine and 1 family medicine clinic affiliated with an academic hospital were sent an electronic survey. Patients were included if they were at least 40 years old, had a primary care provider at the specified site, and were seen in the last year. Patients were excluded if they had an indication for aspirin other than primary prevention. Responses were collected from 15 February to 16 March 2022. Analyses were performed to identify predictors of primary prevention aspirin use and predictors of guideline-discordant aspirin use; aspirin users and nonusers were compared using Fisher exact test, independent samples t tests, and multivariable logistic regression. Of the 1460 patients sent a survey, 668 (45.8%) responded. Of the respondents, 132 (24.1%) reported aspirin use that was confirmed to be for primary prevention. Overall, 46.2% to 58.3% of primary prevention aspirin users were potentially taking aspirin, contrary to the guideline recommendations. Predictors of discordant aspirin use included a history of diabetes mellitus and medication initiation by a primary care provider. In conclusion, primary prevention aspirin use may be overutilized and discordant with recent guideline recommendations for approximately half of the patients, suggesting a need for aspirin deimplementation. These efforts may be best focused at the primary care level.",10.1182/bloodadvances.2024014220,University of Michigan Medical School,,36114016500.0,

The COVID-19 pandemic expanded the use of telehealth for prescribing medications for opioid use disorder (OUD). The uptake of telehealth has been variable, and this uneven expansion has created natural experiments to test assumptions and answer key questions about what improves outcomes for patients with OUD. Many current quality of care measures are not patient centered and do not focus on the practical questions that clinicians face. What criteria should be met before prescribing buprenorphine? Are physical exams necessary? Does the frequency and type of drug testing predict clinical outcomes? Are short check-in visits by phone or video better than less frequent in-person visits? Answering these questions can help define the essential components of high-quality care for patients with OUD. Defining the features of high-quality care can help create guardrails that will help protect our patients from potentially exploitive and ineffective care. Telehealth will likely end up being one additional tool to deliver care, but the scientific questions that can be answered during this period of rapid change can help answer some of the fundamental questions about providing high-quality care—and that will help all our patients, no matter how care is delivered.",10.1080/08897077.2022.2127140,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9195-0869,57204622556.0,

Most infections in healthy young adults are mild; severe illnesses rarely occur. In Fall 2022, an adenovirus outbreak was identified in university students. Methods: HAdV cases were defined as university students 17-26 years old who presented to the University Health Service or nearby emergency department with flu-like symptoms (eg, fever, cough, headache, myalgia, nausea) and had confirmed adenovirus infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Demographic and clinical characteristics were abstracted from electronic medical records; clinical severity was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. We performed contact investigations among critical cases. A subset of specimens was sequenced to confirm the HAdV type. Results: From 28 September 2022 to 30 January 2023, 90 PCR-confirmed cases were identified (51% female; mean age, 19.6 years). Most cases (88.9%) had mild illness. Seven cases required hospitalization, including 2 critical cases that required intensive care. Contact investigation identified 44 close contacts; 6 (14%) were confirmed HAdV cases and 8 (18%) reported symptoms but never sought care. All typed HAdV-positive specimens (n = 36) were type 4. Conclusions: While most students with confirmed HAdV had mild illness, 7 otherwise healthy students had severe or critical illness. Between the relatively high number of hospitalizations and proportion of close contacts with symptoms who did not seek care, the true number of HAdV cases was likely higher.

This study aims to understand AYA perspectives regarding the medical and legal consequences of prenatal and parental cannabis use. Methods: This study delivered five open-ended survey questions regarding prenatal cannabis use in May/June 2022 via a text message polling platform to the MyVoice cohort, a cohort of AYA aged 14–24 throughout the United States recruited from social media to target national benchmarks set by the American Community Survey. We used qualitative content analysis to analyze open-ended responses and summarized code frequency and demographic data with descriptive statistics. Results: Of 826 AYAs, 666 responded to at least one question (response rate = 80.6 %) and the mean age of respondents was 19.9 years (SD = 2.3). We identified four themes from responses: (1) AYA believe cannabis is harmful during pregnancy, (2) they are divided on whether prenatal cannabis exposure should be considered child abuse or neglect, (3) they have mixed attitudes about safe parenting and regular cannabis use, and (4) they support counseling from health care professionals about prenatal cannabis use. Conclusions: AYAs were concerned about potential risks of prenatal cannabis exposure and want clinicians to counsel about cannabis use during pregnancy. More than one in three AYAs surveyed felt prenatal cannabis use should be classified as child abuse or neglect, in contrast to the declining perception of risk among pregnant people.",10.1016/j.addbeh.2024.108059,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9195-0869,57204622556.0,

Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess racial bias in newborn drug testing and to investigate the association between prenatal tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exposure and subsequent child maltreatment. Participants and Setting. This retrospective cohort study (n = 35,437) linked University of Michigan Hospital birth data and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services child maltreatment data relative to a 2018 policy change. Prior to 2018, prenatal THC exposure was routinely substantiated as physical abuse; after 2018 THC exposure was investigated but not automatically substantiated. Methods: We defined prenatal THC exposure as a positive newborn meconium drug test for THC. The primary outcome was a substantiated Child Protective Services (CPS) report of maltreatment before and after the policy change. Demographic variables included parent age, race, ethnicity, zip code and insurance type. Covariates included prenatal urine drug test orders and results, and newborn drug test orders and results. Regression models estimated the rate of subsequent maltreatment and racial disparities associated with newborn testing. Results: Regression analyses indicated that Black and multiracial newborns were significantly more likely to be tested for substance exposure at birth. Newborns with a test positive for THC only were not more likely to experience maltreatment after the policy change as compared with newborns that tested negative and newborns not tested. Conclusions: The evidence strongly supports a policy to end routine CPS investigations for cannabis exposure and eliminate racially biased drug testing practices.",10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.107175,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9195-0869,57204622556.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: Buprenorphine is an underused treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) that can be prescribed in general medical settings. Founded in 2017, the Michigan Opioid Collaborative (MOC) is an outreach and educational program that aims to address clinician and community barriers to buprenorphine access; however, the association between the MOC and buprenorphine treatment is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the association between MOC service use and county-level temporal trends of density of buprenorphine prescribers and patients receiving buprenorphine. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study exploited staggered implementation of MOC services across all Michigan counties. Difference-in-difference analyses were conducted by applying linear fixed-effects regression across all counties to estimate the overall association of MOC engagement with outcomes and linear regression for each MOC-engaged county separately to infer county-specific results using data from May 2015 to August 2020. Analyses were conducted from September 2021 to November 2023. Exposures: MOC engagement. Main Outcomes and Measures: County-level monthly numbers of buprenorphine prescribers and patients receiving buprenorphine (per 100000 population). Results: Among 83 total counties, 57 counties (68.7%) in Michigan were engaged by MOC by 2020, with 3 (3.6%) initiating engagement in 2017, 19 (22.9%) in 2018, 27 (32.5%) in 2019, and 8 (9.6%) in 2020. Michigan is made up of 83 counties with a total population size of 9990000. A total of 5070000 (50.8%) were female, 1410000 (14.1%) were African American or Black, 530000 (5.3%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 7470000 (74.7%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) value of median age across counties was 44.8 (6.4). The monthly increases in buprenorphine prescriber numbers in the preengagement (including all time points for nonengaged counties) and postengagement periods were 0.07 and 0.39 per 100000 population, respectively, with the absolute difference being 0.33 (95% CI, 0.12-0.53) prescribers per 100 000 population (P =.002). The numbers of patients receiving buprenorphine increased by an average of 0.6 and 7.15 per 100000 population per month in preengagement and postengagement periods, respectively, indicating an estimated additional 6.56 (95% CI, 2.09-11.02) patients receiving buprenorphine per 100 000 population (P =.004) monthly increase after engagement compared with before. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study measuring buprenorphine prescriptions in Michigan over time, counties' engagement in OUD-focused outreach and clinician education services delivered by a multidisciplinary team was associated with a temporal increase in buprenorphine prescribers and patients receiving buprenorphine..",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.49103,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0001-9195-0869,57204622556.0,
Christopher Frank,Racial Disparities in Newborn Drug Testing After Implementation of Question-Based Screening for Prenatal Substance Use,2024.0,Obstetrics and Gynecology,Article,Tin,"2024 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of universal question-based screening for prenatal substance use on racial inequities in prenatal and newborn drug testing. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32,802 live births of patients receiving prenatal care at an academic medical center in the midwestern United States from 2014 to 2022, before and after implementation of question-based screening in 2018. Primary outcomes included prenatal and newborn drug test orders. Logistic regression models using a generalized estimating equation framework assessed associations with question-based screening and results, birthing parent age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and insurance type. Charts of patients who indicated difficulties stopping substance use were audited for guideline-directed care. RESULTS: A total of 12,725 of 14,992 pregnant people (85.3%) received question-based screening. Implementation of question-based screening was associated with a decrease in prenatal urine test orders (5.0% [95% CI, 4.6-5.3%] before implementation, 3.1% [95% CI, 2.8-3.4%] after implementation; P<.001), with Black birthing parents having the largest reduction in prenatal urine drug testing (10.3% [95% CI, 9.0-11.7%] before implementation, 4.9% [95% CI, 3.9-5.9%] after implementation). However, rates of newborn drug testing did not change (4.7% [95% CI, 4.4-5.0%] before implementation, 4.5% [95% CI, 4.2-4.8%] after implementation; P5.46), and clinicians continued to order significantly more newborn drug tests for newborns of Black birthing parents compared with other race and ethnicity groups. CONCLUSION: Implementation of question-based screening for substance use in pregnancy was associated with decreased prenatal urine drug testing but no change in overall newborn drug testing or racial inequities in newborn drug testing for Black birthing people. Further policy efforts are warranted to improve substance use treatment and to eliminate racial inequities in punitive policies such as newborn drug testing and subsequent child protective services reporting.",10.1097/AOG.0000000000005631,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9195-0869,57204622556.0,

Christopher Frank,Structural Racism in Newborn Drug Testing: Perspectives of Health Care and Child Protective Services Professionals,2024.0,Annals of Family Medicine,Article,Tin; Child; child abuse; health inequities; implicit bias; qualitative research; racism,"2024, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc. All rights reserved.PURPOSE Black birthing parents and their newborns disproportionately experience newborn drug testing for prenatal substance exposure by health care professionals (HCPs), which contributes to Child Protective Services (CPS) reporting, family separation, and termination of parental rights. This qualitative study aims to interrogate dominant power structures by exploring knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of HCPs and CPS professionals regarding the influence of structural racism on inequities in newborn drug testing practices. METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with 30 physicians, midwives, nurses, social workers, and CPS professionals guided by an explanatory framework, and conducted inductive, reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS We identified 3 primary themes: (1) levels of racism beyond the hospital structure contributed to higher rates of drug testing for Black newborns; (2) inconsistent hospital policies led to racialized application of state law and downstream CPS reporting; and (3) health care professionals knowledge of the benefits and disproportionate harms of CPS reporting on Black families influenced their decision making. CONCLUSION Health care professionals recognized structural racism as a driver of disproportionate newborn drug testing. Lack of knowledge and skill limitations of HCPs were barriers to dismantling power structures, thus impeding systems-level change. Institutional changes should shift focus from biologic testing and reporting to supporting the mutual needs of birthing parent and child through family-centered substance use treatment. State and federal policy changes are needed to ensure health equity for Black families and eliminate reporting to CPS for prenatal substance exposure when no concern for child abuse and neglect exists.",10.1370/afm.3139,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Treatment outcomes vary widely depending on treatment timing and severity of the deformity. The relative impact of these factors on success rates is not well known. Objective: This study aimed to quantify success rates of CRO treatment, based on age at initiation of treatment and the severity of cranial deformity. Study Design: This is a retrospective cohort study of infants treated for positional plagiocephaly with a CRO. Methods: A total of 300 infants with deformational plagiocephaly who were treated with a CRO were categorized into four groups by corrected age at initiation of orthotic treatment (<22 weeks, 22–25 weeks, 26–30 weeks, and >30 weeks) and into four groups by severity of their deformity (initial cranial vault asymmetry of 6–9 mm, 10–12 mm, 13–16 mm, and 17+ mm). Success rates were compared across the groups. A successful outcome was defined as achieving a final cranial vault asymmetry of 5 mm or less. Results: The overall success rate for CRO treatment was 75%. However, success rates among the groups varied from 6% to 98%, depending on the severity and the age at initiation. Severity had a more significant effect on success rates than age at initiation. The age at initiation became more influential in determining the likelihood of success when the infant's deformity was severe. Conclusions: The likelihood of achieving a successful treatment outcome with a CRO varies greatly depending on the severity of the deformity and corrected age at initiation of treatment, with severity having the greater impact. Clinical Relevance: This study provides clinicians with treatment outcomes categorized by severity and corrected age at initiation to aid in setting appropriate expectations for treatment outcomes.",10.1097/JPO.0000000000000481,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9195-0869,57204622556.0,

Typical treatment durations are well documented. However, treatment duration can be affected by multiple factors and may not be a true representation of the time necessary to achieve a successful clinical outcome. Objective: This study compared the time to achieve a successful clinical outcome against the total treatment duration for cranial remolding orthosis therapy in infants with deformational plagiocephaly. Study design: This is a retrospective study of infants treated for deformational plagiocephaly with a cranial remolding orthosis. Methods: A total of 300 infants with deformational plagiocephaly who were treated with a cranial remolding orthosis were grouped by corrected age at initiation of treatment and by severity of deformity. A successful outcome was defined as achieving a final cranial vault asymmetry of 5 mm or less. For the 226 infants who achieved a successful outcome, time to successful outcome and treatment duration were compared between the groups. Results: The time to successful outcome depended on severity but not on age at initiation. The median time to successful outcome ranged from 6 weeks to 17.5 weeks, depending on the severity of the deformity. Time to successful outcome was significantly shorter than treatment duration for infants with an initial cranial vault asymmetry of less than 17 mm. Conclusion: Current treatment durations for infants with moderate plagiocephaly may be longer than necessary.

Expedited partner therapy (EPT), treating the partner of patients with STIs, is an evidence-based practice for patients who might not otherwise seek care. Little is known about the use of EPT in the ED. In a national survey, we describe ED medical directors' knowledge, attitudes, and practices of EPT. Methods A cross-sectional survey of medical directors from academic EDs was conducted from July to September 2020 using the Academy of Academic Administrators of Emergency Medicine Benchmarking Group. Primary outcomes were EPT awareness, support, and use. The survey also examined barriers and facilitators. Results Forty-eight of 70 medical directors (69%) responded. Seventy-three percent were aware of EPT, but fewer knew how to prescribe it (38%), and only 19% of EDs had implemented EPT. Seventy-nine percent supported EPT and were more likely to if they were aware of EPT (89% vs. 54%; P = 0.01). Of nonimplementers, 41% thought EPT was feasible, and 56% thought departmental support would be likely. Emergency department directors were most concerned about legal liability, but a large proportion (44%) viewed preventing sequelae of untreated STIs as ""extremely important.""Conclusions Emergency department medical directors expressed strong support for EPT and reasonable levels of feasibility for implementation but low utilization.

They have also been shown to be useful in health promotion and have been used to track several key metrics (eg, comments, posts) among users of all demographics. However, there is a lack of research on the impact and reach of these social media platforms as a community-based tool for disseminating sexual health information and for increasing engagement among Black adolescents and young adults, which is a targeted high-risk population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the social media platforms and banner advertisements that affected engagement among Black male adolescents and young adults in participating in web-based health surveys. Methods: A web-based survey was conducted from March 2019 to July 2019 to assess sexual health and health behaviors in a convenience sample of Black male adolescents and young adults in the age range of 18-24 years (N=170). Social media metrics from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter were monitored. This cross-sectional survey comprised several categories, including basic personal information, drug-related risk behaviors, health care, sexual reproductive health questions, attitudes, norms, and perceived control, mental health, violence-related risk behaviors, and social media preferences. Results: Social media advertisements on the Black Male Opinion survey reached approximately 146,412 individuals. Our primary finding of the web-based survey engagement was that referral (eg, group chat, indirect social media sharing) led to as the greatest proportion of recruitment, with Twitter and YouTube as the preferred sites to receive sexual health information. Conclusions: Recognizing the variety of technologies being used among Black male young adults and adolescents can help the community, researchers, and health care providers understand the web-based engagement of this high-risk population. This information may also promote culturally sensitive, customized marketing on sexual health information for this population.",10.2196/19219,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0001-9411-2473,57203971419.0,

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Sexually transmitted infections (STI), including Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, have reached record high rates in the United States. Sexually transmitted infections disproportionately affect reproductive-aged females aged 15-44 years, who account for 65% and 42% of the total reported C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae cases, respectively. Undiagnosed STIs can result in serious health complications that put women at an increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal factor infertility. Many of these women are seen by physicians (eg, obstetrician-gynecologists, family medicine doctors, pediatricians) or other clinicians (eg, nurse practitioners, midwives, physician assistants) who care for women. These clinicians have the opportunity to help curb the continued increase in STI incidence rates with the implementation and use of expedited partner therapy. Expedited partner therapy is a proven effective health care practice that allows clinicians to give patients medications or prescriptions to distribute to their partners. Despite expedited partner therapy's proven effectiveness, there are barriers to its implementation that must be understood to enhance STI treatment and prevention efforts. In this commentary, we discuss these barriers, and appeal to women's health clinicians to implement or increase use of expedited partner therapy for the treatment of women with STIs and their sexual partners.",10.1097/AOG.0000000000003088,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9411-2473,57203971419.0,

Only one-third of individuals with T2D receive care as recommended by the American Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines. Effective strategies are needed to accelerate the implementation of guideline concordant T2D care. Methods: The Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D) is a statewide population health collaborative quality initiative (CQI) developed to improve the care of all people with T2D in Michigan. MCT2D has developed a learning health system with physician organizations and their constituent practices to support quality improvement initiatives focused on (1) improving use of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy to improve cardiorenal outcomes, (2) increasing evidence-based use of continuous glucose monitoring, and (3) supporting use of lower carbohydrate eating patterns. Results: Between 2021 and 2022, MCT2D recruited 28 of the 40 Michigan-based physician organizations participating in Blue Cross’ Physician Group Incentive Program with 336 constituent practices and 1357 physicians in primary care (304), endocrinology (21) and nephrology (11). In January 2022, baseline data included a sample of 96,140 unique individuals with T2D. The baseline HbA1c was ≤ 7.0% for 66.3% of patients (n = 32,787), while 14.9% of patients had a most recent HbA1c ≥ 8.0% (n = 7,393). The most recent body mass index (BMI) was ≥ 30.0 for 64.8% of patients (n = 38,516). Discussion: MCT2D has organized a statewide collaborative to recruit and engage a diverse and large set of physician organizations and their constituent practices. This is a promising opportunity to accelerate adoption of guideline-concordant care for people with T2D and may be a model for other state or regional collaboratives. Future directions include specific evidence-based interventions targeted at reducing diabetes-linked comorbidities and associated healthcare costs as well as strategies focused on T2D prevention among at-risk populations.",10.1186/s12913-024-11520-z,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9411-2473,57203971419.0,

Effective programs and policies are necessary to address this growing public health problem. The purpose of this study is to assess the perspectives of a national sample of youth on access to STI care and behaviors regarding STIs. Methods: MyVoice, a national text message survey of youth, was used to pose four open-ended questions on STI screening and treatment to 1115 youth aged 14–24 in August 2018. A mixed-methods strategy was employed for the study. Qualitative data was analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. Summary statistics were calculated for demographic data and prevalence of themes.

Due to the high incidence of STIs among youth, we sought to understand youth awareness and beliefs about EPT use. Methods: MyVoice, a national text message survey of youth aged 14–24 years, posed 5 questions on EPT knowledge and perceptions to 1,115 youth in August 2018.

Summary statistics were calculated for demographic and thematic analysis. Results: A total of 835 participants responded to at least 1 question (74.9% response rate). Majority of youth (91.9%, n = 730/794) felt that it would be important to help their partners get treatment if they tested positive for chlamydia or gonorrhea. Although most participants were unaware of EPT (86.4%, n = 657/760), 81.3% (n = 624/768) supported the policy stating that it is “pretty darn convenient.” Youth also noted they would be interested in asking their provider for EPT. Participants opposing EPT (6.9%, n = 53/768) noted that “they [sexual partner] are responsible for their own health” and preferred to “tell my partner to go to [their] doctor.” Conclusions: Most youth in the MyVoice cohort felt that EPT was a good way to get treatment for their partners, even though the majority were not aware that EPT was available as an STI treatment option.",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.06.021,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9411-2473,57203971419.0,

To understand where patients with STIs seek healthcare, we evaluated the relationship between CT infections and the place where individuals report usually receiving healthcare. Methods Our study used a nationally representative sample from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2016. The study population is adult patients, aged 18 to 39 years in whom a urine CT screen was obtained. Logistic regression models were used to determine if location of usual healthcare was predictive of a positive urine CT screen result. Models were adjusted for known confounders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and insurance status. Results In this nationally representative sample (n = 19,275; weighted n = 85.8 million), 1.9% of individuals had a positive urine CT result. Participants reported usually going to the doctor’s office (70.3%), “no place” (24.8%), Emergency Department (ED) (3.3%), or “other” place (1.7%) for healthcare. In adjusted models, the predicted probability of having a positive urine CT result is higher (4.9% vs 3.2%, p = 0.022; OR = 1.58) among those that reported the ED as their usual place for healthcare compared to those that reported going to a doctor’s office or clinic. Conclusions Individuals having a positive urine CT screen are associated with using the ED as a usual source for healthcare. Understanding this association has the potential to improve STI clinical and policy interventions as the ED may be a critical site in combatting the record high rates of STIs.",10.1371/journal.pone.0251113,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1945-6046,57203971419.0,

It is also not unexpected that programs rely heavily on physicians as clinical instructors. This situation, however, is changing. An increasing number of PA graduates are serving as role models and as instructors in patient care settings. These graduates are also assuming positions of leadership in PA programs.

Twenty-two family physicians responded to a mail survey in which they selected from among their respective practices a sample of patients whose care they considered to be particularly difficult. This sampling procedure resulted in a total of 205 difficult patients. Physicians' perceptions of these patients were obtained through ratings of the applicability of 40 behavioral and physical characteristics drawn from the literature. Factor analysis of these data resulted in the identification of two factors underlying physicians' perceptions of difficult patients: medical uncertainty, characterized by particularly vague, difficult to describe, undifferentiated medical problems; and interpersonal difficulty, reflected in a perceived abrasive behavioral style. In addition, physicians self-rated the importance of various motivations for practicing medicine. The top six ranked mean ratings indicate that the primary motivations for practicing medicine were satisfactory derived from solving medical problems and the desire to help people. The interaction of these physician and patient characteristics is offered as a partial explanation for the development of difficult physician-patient relationships.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,7003801922.0,

Dale Lefever,Clinical teaching in physician’s assistant training programs,1980.0,Journal of Medical Education,Article,"teaching physician, assistant training, clinical instructors, clinical teaching, physicians clinical, physician assistant, physician, pa faculty, role physicians","This is a report on the clinical component of physician’s assistant (PA) training programs. Given the significant role physicians played in establishing the new profession, it is not surprising many PA programs are built on the traditional model of medical education, with clinical training occurring after didactic and laboratory-based courses in the basic sciences. It is also not unexpected that programs rely heavily on physicians as clinical instructors. This situation, however, is changing. An increasing number of PA graduates are serving as role models and as instructors in patient care settings. These graduates are also assuming positions of leadership in PA programs. Like their counterparts in medical schools, the PA faculty members surveyed in this project are not adequately prepared for their work as teachers, but they do demonstrate an eagerness to enhance their skills and to continue to upgrade the quality of teaching in their programs. Two areas in which PA faculty would particularly like help are evaluation and faculty development. © 1980, Association of American Medical Colleges.",,University of Miami Leonard M.

Despite clinical practice guideline recommendations, effective pharmacotherapy, and interventions to support patients and providers, up to 60% of patients diagnosed with T2DM are estimated to have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels above the recommended targets owing to multilevel barriers hindering optimal glycemic control. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare changes in HbA1c levels among patients with suboptimally controlled T2DM who were offered the opportunity to use an intermittently viewed continuous glucose monitor and receive personalized low-carbohydrate nutrition counseling (<100 g/day) versus those who received usual care (UC). Methods: This was a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized quality improvement program. All adult patients with T2DM who received primary care at a university-affiliated primary care clinic (N=1584) were randomized to either the UC or the enhanced care (EC) group. Within each program arm, we identified individuals with HbA1c >7.5% (58 mmol/mol) who were medically eligible for tighter glycemic control, and we defined these subgroups as UC–high risk (UC-HR) or EC-HR. UC-HR participants (n=197) received routine primary care. EC-HR participants (n=185) were invited to use an intermittently viewed continuous glucose monitor and receive low-carbohydrate nutrition counseling. The primary outcome was mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 12 months using an intention-to-treat difference-in-differences analysis comparing EC-HR with UC-HR groups. We conducted follow-up semistructured interviews to understand EC-HR participant experiences with the intervention. Results: HbA1c decreased by 0.41% (4.5 mmol/mol; P=.04) more from baseline to 12 months among participants in the EC-HR group than among those in UC-HR; however, only 61 (32.9%) of 185 EC-HR participants engaged in the program. Among the EC-HR participants who wore continuous glucose monitors (61/185, 32.9%), HbA1c was 1.1% lower at 12 months compared with baseline (P<.001). Interviews revealed themes related to EC-HR participants’ program engagement and continuous glucose monitor use. Conclusions: Among patients with suboptimally controlled T2DM, a combined approach that includes continuous glucose monitoring and low-carbohydrate nutrition counseling can improve glycemic control compared with the standard of care.",10.2196/31184,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,
David Charles Serlin,Diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes mellitus,2009.0,American Family Physician,Review,Diabetes Mellitus,"Gestational diabetes occurs in 5 to 9 percent of pregnancies in the United States and is growing in prevalence. It is a controversial entity, with conflicting guidelines and treatment protocols. Recent studies show that diagnosis and management of this disorder have beneficial effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes, including reduced rates of shoulder dystocia, fractures, nerve palsies, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Diagnosis is made using a sequential model of universal screening with a 50-g one-hour glucose challenge test, followed by a diagnostic 100-g three-hour oral glucose tolerance test for women with a positive screening test. Treatment consists of glucose monitoring, dietary modification, exercise, and, when necessary, pharmacotherapy to maintain euglycemia. Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment, although glyburide and metformin may become more widely used. In women receiving pharmacotherapy, antenatal testing with nonstress tests and amniotic fluid indices beginning in the third trimester is generally used to monitor fetal well-being. The method and timing of delivery are controversial. Women with gestational diabetes are at high risk of subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modification should therefore be encouraged, along with regular screening for diabetes.

As part of a Quality Improvement (QI) project at a large, midwestern health system, a case series of high-performing organizations was explored with the goal of identifying best practices in patient-centered care and/or care coordination (PCC/CC). Identification of best practices was done through rapid realist review of peer-reviewed literature supporting three PCC/CC interventions per case. Mechanisms responsible for successful intervention outcomes and associated institutional-level facilitators were evaluated, and cross-case analysis produced high-level focus items for health system leadership, including (1) institutional values surrounding PCC/CC, (2) optimization of IT infrastructure to enhance performance and communication, (3) pay structures and employment models that enhance accountability, and (4) organizing bodies to support implementation efforts. Health systems may use this review to gain insight into how institutional-level factors may facilitate small-scale PCC/CC behaviors, or to conduct similar assessments in their own QI projects. Based on our analysis, we recommend health systems seeking to improve PCC/CC at any level or scale to evaluate how IT infrastructure affects provider-provider and provider-patient communication, and the extent to which institutional prioritization of PCC/CC is manifest and held accountable in performance feedback, incentivization, and values shared among departments and settings. Ideally, this evaluation work should be performed and/or supported by cross-department organizing bodies specifically devoted to PCC/CC implementation work.",10.1186/s12913-022-08623-w,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,

Objectives: This quality improvement intervention was designed to improve HTN control among community-dwelling adults through collaboration between patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) within an academic medical center and chain community pharmacies. Methods: Four PCMH sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan that were in close proximity to two Meijer pharmacies participated in this study between September 2016 and March 2017, which compared HTN outcomes for patients seen at two community pharmacies where the pharmacists received training on HTN management for patients who received usual care at their PCMH. The primary outcome was percent of patients who met their blood pressure (BP) goal of either <140/90 mmHg or < 150/90 mmHg compared with matched controls who received usual care at the PCMH. Secondary outcomes included number of medication recommendations made, percent of recommendations accepted by the primary care provider (PCP), and patient satisfaction. Results: Patients who received care at the community pharmacy (n = 155) had a higher rate of BP control at 3 months than matched controls (61.8% vs 47.7%, P = 0.013). A total of 29 medication recommendations were made by community pharmacists and 26 were accepted by the PCP. Nearly 95% of patients rated the care they received as excellent or very good and over 95% stated that they would recommend the pharmacist at the Meijer pharmacy to their family and friends. Conclusion: Patients who received HTN management services as part of a collaboration between an academic medical center and chain community pharmacy were significantly more likely to have controlled BP at 3 months compared with matched controls who received standard care. This model shows promise as being a strategy to expand access to care for patients while being mutually beneficial for community pharmacies and health systems.",10.1002/jac5.1158,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,1413762353.0

All rights reserved.Purpose: To explore the perceptions of pharmacists and administrators who had an integral role in designing and operationalizing an integrated community pharmacist hypertension management program with collaboration between an academic medical center and a regional chain community pharmacy. Summary: Community pharmacists (n = 3), ambulatory care pharmacists (n = 2), medical directors (n = 2), and health-system (n = 1) and pharmacy (n = 1) administrators reported positive experiences engaging with the hypertension management program. Strengths of the program included comprehensive training by the ambulatory care pharmacists, community pharmacist access to the electronic health record (EHR), and primary care providers who were receptive to referring patients and accepting recommendations from the community pharmacists. All participants felt that the program had a positive outlook and saw opportunity for expansion, such as extended hours of operation, new locations, and additional pharmacists. Conclusion: Pharmacists are well positioned to extend hypertension management programs from primary care clinics into local pharmacies if they have appropriate training, access to the EHR, and ongoing support from collaborating primary care offices. Additional research using implementation science methods is needed to further test the scalability and replicability of the program among different patient populations, community pharmacies, and health systems.",10.1093/ajhp/zxac081,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,

Objective: To explore primary care provider (PCP) perceptions of a HTN management program in which patients at the PCMH with elevated blood pressure could choose to receive follow-up care with a trained community pharmacist at a chain community pharmacy. Methods: We conducted informal interviews with 8 PCPs with a range of level of involvement with the collaborative HTN management program to inform the development of a 13-question online survey that was distributed to PCPs at 10 participating Michigan Medicine PCMH clinics. The primary outcome was the percent of PCPs who reported that the program improved their patient's blood pressure. Secondary outcomes included awareness of the program, alternative follow-up strategies, PCP satisfaction, and barriers to using the program. Results: A total of 39 PCPs (30.0%) responded to the survey. More than one-half (n = 21 of 39, 53.9%) of respondents reported that at least 1 of their patients had seen a trained community pharmacist for HTN management services. Almost all of these PCPs (n = 19 of 21, 90.5%) reported being satisfied with the program, and 80.9% (n = 17 of 21) agreed that it helped patients improve their blood pressure control. The most common barriers identified were patients preferring to follow up directly with their PCP (n = 18 of 39, 46.2%), PCPs being more comfortable with patients having a visit with an embedded ambulatory care pharmacist (n = 16 of 39, 41.0%), and a lack of written materials to share with patients about the program (n = 15 of 39, 38.5%). Conclusion: PCPs who used the integrated community pharmacy HTN management program were satisfied with the program and thought that it resulted in improved blood pressure control. PCPs may benefit from written information to share with their patients as well as education to increase their awareness of the program and its beneficial effect on patient blood pressure.",10.1016/j.japh.2020.11.022,,0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,

The condition predominantly affects men. The most common causes are obstructive in nature, with benign prostatic hyperplasia accounting for 53% of cases. Infectious, inflammatory, iatrogenic, and neurologic causes can also affect urinary retention. Initial evaluation should involve a detailed history that includes information about current prescription medications and use of over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements. A focused physical examination with neurologic evaluation should be performed, and diagnostic testing should include measurement of postvoid residual (PVR) volume of urine. There is no consensus regarding a PVR-based definition for acute urinary retention;the American Urological Association recommends that chronic urinary retention be defined as PVR volume greater than 300 mL measured on two separate occasions and persisting for at least six months. Initial management of urinary retention involves assessment of urethral patency with prompt and complete bladder decompression by catheterization. Suprapubic catheters improve patient comfort and decrease bacteriuria and the need for recatheterization in the short term;silver alloy–coated and antibiotic-impregnated catheters offer clinically insignificant or no benefit. Further management is decided by determining the cause and chronicity of the urinary retention and can include initiation of alpha blockers with voiding trials. Patients with urinary retention related to an underlying neurologic cause should be monitored in conjunction with neurology and urology subspecialists.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With the emergence of COVID-19, tele-medicine use has increased dramatically as clinicians and patients have looked for alternatives to face-to-face care. Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout. There was a high level of satisfaction at our institution despite multiple technical challenges.",10.22454/FamMed.2021.613099,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7026-4149,27467963900.0,

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for most new HIV diagnoses in the US. Annual HIV testing is recommended for sexually active MSM if HIV status is negative or unknown. Our primary study aim was to determine annual HIV screening rates in primary care across multiple years for HIV-negative MSM to estimate compliance with guidelines. A secondary exploratory endpoint was to document rates for non-MSM in primary care. Methods We conducted a three-year retrospective cohort study, analyzing data from electronic medical records of HIV-negative men aged 18 to 45 years in primary care at a large academic health system using inferential and logistic regression modeling. Results Of 17,841 men, 730 (4.1%) indicated that they had a male partner during the study period. MSM were screened at higher rates annually than non-MSM (about 38% vs. 9%, p<0.001). Younger patients (p-value<0.001) and patients with an internal medicine primary care provider (p-value<0.001) were more likely to have an HIV test ordered in both groups. For all categories of race and self-reported illegal drug use, MSM patients had higher odds of HIV test orders than non-MSM patients. Race and drug use did not have a significant effect on HIV orders in the MSM group. Among non-MSM, Black patients had higher odds of being tested than both White and Asian patients regardless of drug use. Conclusions While MSM are screened for HIV at higher rates than non-MSM, overall screening rates remain lower than desired, particularly for older patients and patients with a family medicine or pediatric PCP. Targeted interventions to improve HIV screening rates for MSM in primary care are discussed.",10.1371/journal.pone.0266747,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7648-883X,7202582929.0,

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + .

The primary aim of this study is to determine the current influence of religion/culture among MENA women and their preferences for physicians of same sex, culture, and religion on the avoidance and uncomfortableness of routine and women's health exams. Methods: A cross sectional community survey including religiosity and the importance of physician matched sex, culture, and religion was completed. Outcome measures were avoidance of a routine physical exam, or a women's health exam because of religious/cultural issues; and the uncomfortableness of the women's health exam. Linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between outcomes and potential predictors, with significance assessed using a bootstrap method. Findings: The responses of 97 MENA women 30–65 years old showed that MENA women agreed that they would avoid routine health exams because of religious/cultural issues if their physician was of the same religion or culture as they were (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively) or they had less education (p < 0.05). MENA women also avoided women's health exams due to religious/cultural issues if her physician was of the same religion as she (p < 0.01). Interpretation: MENA women 30–65 years old may no longer be bound to a female physician of their same religion/culture for their health exams.

Diane Medved Harper,Cost-effectiveness of p16/Ki-67 Dual-Stained Cytology Reflex Following Co-testing with hrHPV Genotyping for Cervical Cancer Screening,2023.0,Cancer Prevention Research,Article,Tin,"2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.The first biomarker-based cervical cancer screening test, p16/Ki-67 dual-stained cytology (DS), has been clinically validated and approved in the United States for triage of women being screened for cervical cancer who test positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV). The primary aim of this work is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DS triage after co-testing findings of positive non-16/18 HPV types and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions cytology. A payer-perspective Markov microsimulation model was developed to assess the impact of DS reflex testing. Each comparison simulated 12, 250 screening-eligible women through health states defined by hrHPV status and genotype, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 1-3, invasive cervical cancer (ICC) by stage, and cancer-related or non-cancer death. Screening test performance data were from the IMPACT clinical validation trial. Transition probabilities were from population and natural history studies. Costs of baseline medical care, screening visits, tests, procedures, and ICC were included. DS reflex after co-testing was cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-year gained of $15, 231 [95% confidence interval (CI), $10, 717-$25, 400] compared with co-testing with hrHPV pooled primary and genotyped reflex testing, and $23, 487 (95% CI, $15, 745-$46, 175) compared with co-testing with hrHPV genotyping with no reflex test. Screening and medical costs and life-years increased, while ICC costs and risk of ICC death decreased. Incorporating DS reflex into co-testing cervical cancer screening algorithms is projected to be cost-effective.",10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-22-0455,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7648-883X,7202582929.0,

All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: Following the publication of Point-of-Care-Ultrasound (POCUS) curriculum guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians in 2016, there has been a rapid expansion in POCUS curricula across family medicine departments in the US. There is growing appreciation for the potential role of POCUS in enhancing the clinical care family physicians provide to patients. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the utilization of POCUS in outpatient clinic care across Family Medicine departments nationwide and to identify perceived or realized barriers in integrating POCUS use for clinic care. Methods: The questions were part of a larger omnibus survey of US Department of Family Medicine chairs, conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) between August 6 to August 31, 2021. Results: 81% of departments have at least 1 POCUS-trained faculty, with 44% of departments using POCUS in some ambulatory clinical care. Currently, only 6% have established billing for the POCUS they perform. Faculty time, as well as funding, for POCUS training were seen as 2 primary barriers. The purchasing of equipment and billing for POCUS were described by FMCs as difficult. Conclusions: As POCUS use continues to rise in Family Medicine, it is imperative to create a more efficient and less hindered road to growth. Collaboration across departments to share best practices in training, purchasing equipment and billing for POCUS will be important to facilitate high-quality POCUS access for our patients.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.04.220019,Michigan Medicine,0000-0001-7648-883X,7202582929.0,

Accurate diagnosis of skin cancers has a significant impact on patient health. Dermoscopy improves a physician’s accuracy in diagnosing skin cancers. We aimed to quantify the current state of dermoscopy use and training in family medicine residencies. Methods: We included questions on dermoscopy training in the 2021 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) survey of family medicine residency program directors. The survey asked about access to a dermatoscope, the presence of faculty with experience using dermoscopy, the amount of dermoscopy didactic time, and the amount of hands-on dermoscopy training. Results: Of 631 programs, 275 program directors (43.58% response rate) responded. Half of the responding programs (50.2%) had access to a dermatoscope, and 54.2% had a faculty member with experience using dermoscopy. However, only 6.8% of residents had 4 or more hours of didactics on dermoscopy over their entire training. Only 16.2% had 4 or more hours of hands-on dermoscopy use. Over half (58.9%) of programs planned to add more dermoscopy training. We did not find any correlations between the program’s size/type/location and dermoscopy training opportunities. Conclusions: Despite reasonable access to a dermatoscope and the presence of at least one faculty member with dermoscopy experience, most family medicine residency programs provided limited dermoscopy training opportunities. Research is needed to better understand how to facilitate dermoscopy training in family medicine residencies.",10.22454/FamMed.2023.368813,"Swedish Medical Center, Seattle",0000-0001-7648-883X,7202582929.0,

Methods: We systematically evaluated individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics associated with HPV vaccination initiation and vaccination series completion among adult females (PROSPERO: CRD42023445721). We performed a literature search on December 14, 2022, and supplemented the search on August 1, 2023. We pooled appropriate multivariable-adjusted results using an inverse variance random-effects model and expressed the results as odds ratios with associated 95 % confidence intervals. A point pooled significantly increased/decreased odds of 30–69 % was regarded to be strongly associated, and ≥ 70 % was very strongly associated. Results: We included 63 cross-sectional studies. There were strongly increased odds of vaccination initiation among White women compared with Black or Asian women, and those with higher education, health insurance, a history of sexually transmitted infection (STI), receipt of influenza vaccination in the preceding year, not married/cohabiting, not smoking, using contraception, and having visited a healthcare provider in the preceding year. We observed very strongly increased odds of vaccination initiation among those younger and having been born in the country of study. Similarly, there were strongly increased odds of completing the vaccination series for the same variables as initiating vaccination, except for higher education, prior STI, smoking and contraception use. Additional variables associated with strongly increased odds of vaccination series completion not seen in initiation were higher annual household income, being lesbian/bisexual, and having a primary care physician. We observed very strongly increased odds of vaccination series completion similar to vaccination initiation but including for White compared with Black women, higher education, and prior cervical cancer screening. Conclusions: These individual characteristics may be the key to identifying women at increased risk of not being vaccinated against HPV and could inform targeted messaging to drive HPV vaccination.",10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.05.042,"Max Rady College of Medicine, University of Manitoba",0000-0001-7648-883X,7202582929.0,

Cervical cancer, caused by HPV, is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, even though it is one of the most preventable cancers. Prevention efforts include HPV vaccination, however these programs remain nascent in many countries. In 2020 the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination including a goal to fully vaccinate 90% of girls with the HPV vaccine by the age of 15. However, very few countries have reached even 70% coverage. Increased vaccine availability in the future may allow the opportunity to vaccinate more people. This could add to the feasibility of introducing gender-neutral HPV vaccination programs. Adopting a gender-neutral HPV vaccine approach will reduce HPV infections transmitted among the population, combat misinformation, minimize vaccine-related stigma, and promote gender equity. We propose approaching programmatic research through a gender-neutral lens to reduce HPV infections and cancers and promote gender equality. In order to design more effective policies and programs, a better understanding of the perspectives of clients, clinicians, community leaders, and policy-makers is needed. A clear, multi-level understanding of these stakeholders' views will facilitate the development of target policy and programs aimed at addressing common barriers and optimizing uptake. Given the benefit of developing gender-neutral HPV vaccination programs to eliminate cervical cancer and address other HPV associated cancers, we must build knowledge through implementation research around this topic to inform policy-makers and funders for future policy shifts.",10.3389/fpubh.2023.1067299,University of Illinois College of Medicine,0000-0001-7648-883X,7202582929.0,

We aim to describe the prevalence and predictors of HPV vaccination initiation among males of White, Black, and Middle-Eastern/North-African (MENA) descent in southeast Michigan. Methods: We conducted three community-based surveys in 2019 that provided primary data via self report. Using population weights and multivariate modeling, we measured the prevalence and predictors of HPV vaccine initiation in each race/ethnicity of men (age 18–34 years) analyzed. Results: The vaccine initiation rates were 44.5 % (95 % CI: 44.4, 44.6) for White men, 46.2 % (46.0, 46.4) for Black men, and 23.2 % (22.8, 23.6) for MENA men, (p < 0.001). Being a student, compared to unemployed or disabled, was significantly associated with HPV vaccine initiation across all three races/ethnicities. Married men of any race/ethnicity were unlikely to be vaccinated. MENA men born in the US and having some college education were also more likely to initiate HPV vaccination.

Diane Medved Harper,Predictors of Human Papillomavirus Seropositivity in Appalachian Women Aged 18 to 26 Years,2021.0,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,Article,Ear; Papilloma; Aged,"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Background Key informants of the Appalachian community questioned whether their unique environmental stressors would alter their immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. The primary aim of this study is to determine predictors of HPV seroprevalence to at least 1 of the 4 vaccine-related HPV types before vaccination using a psychoneuroimmunologic model in Appalachian women. Method Women aged 18 to 26 years (n = 185) who had not received HPV vaccination provided cervical HPV DNA and blood samples. Human papillomavirus DNA was identified through Hybrid Capture 2 assay and then genotyped for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by Roche Linear Array. Competitive Luminex Immunoassay measured the type-specific antibodies to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in milli-Merck units per milliliter. Nine psychoneuroimmunology scales measuring attributes of stress were self-completed. Results Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 50% (92/183) of participants, with only 14% (26/183) positive for HPV-6/11/16/18 DNA. Seropositivity for at least one anti-HPV-6/11/16 or 18, on the other hand, was present in 35% (64/183) of women, with only 10% (19/183) concomitantly infected and seropositive for the vaccine-related types. The Perceived Stress Scale was not a strong predictor of HPV seropositivity. Conclusions Both HPV infection and vaccine-related HPV type seropositivity is common among Appalachian women aged 18 to 26 years. The anticipated effect of environmental stressors on HPV seropositivity was not seen when multiple predictors were considered.",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001416,Penn State Health Milton S.

This paper aims to present woman-centric cervical cancer and CRC screenings to determine the predictor of being up-to-date for both. Methods: We used the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an annual survey to guide health policy in the United States, to explore the up-to-date status of dual cervical cancer and CRC screening for women 50–64 years old. We categorized women into four mutually exclusive categories: up-to-date for dual-screening, each single screen, or neither screen. We used multinomial multivariate regression modeling to evaluate the predictors of each category. Results: Among women ages 50–64 years old, dual-screening was reported for 58.2% (57.1–59.4), cervical cancer screening alone (27.1% (26.0–28.2)), CRC screening alone (5.4% (4.9–5.9)), and neither screen (9.3% (8.7–9.9)). Age, race, education, income, and chronic health conditions were significantly associated with dual-screening compared to neither screen. Hispanic women compared to non-Hispanic White women were more likely to be up-to-date with cervical cancer screening than dual-screening (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.39 (1.10, 1.77)). Compared to younger women, those 60–64 years are significantly more likely to be up-to-date with CRC screening than dual-screening (aOR = 1.75 (1.30, 2.35)). Conclusions: Screening received by each woman shows a much lower rate of dual-screening than prior single cancer screening rates.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vasectomy is considered a permanent contraceptive method with fewer associated harms than bilateral tubal ligation. However, the number of vasectomy-trained providers may not be meeting the demand for vasectomy in the United States. We describe the vasectomy training landscape in family medicine residencies and factors related to increased procedural training. METHODS: Program-specific data were collected from the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) national survey of family medicine program directors in 2019. Program characteristics, vasectomy training (eg, time spent, procedural numbers), as well as direct and specific faculty support are described, with bivariate analyses for factors related to procedural competency, defined as more than five vasectomy procedures per resident. RESULTS: We received responses from 250 program directors (response rate=39.8%), with representation across all US regions, and program types. Nearly half (47.5%) offered less than 1 day of vasectomy didactics and/or procedural training; 38.9% of programs reported having a family medicine faculty champion for vasectomy. Only 16 programs (6.8%) reported that their average graduating residents performed more than five vasectomies. Programs with a faculty champion (OR 28.1, CI 3.6-216.4) or family medicine faculty as primary trainer (OR 17.6, CI 2.2-138.2) were more likely to graduate residents who had performed more than five vasectomies.

Many persons interested in cervical cancer screening are eager to opt out of the invasive speculum exam and opt into the self-sampling. There is no limitation on which persons can choose self-sampling. Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse assigned female at birth (TGD AFAB) people experience barriers such as gender dysphoria and discomfort with sensitive exams. They may find more comfort with this equivalent method of screening. However, no clinical guidelines describe the best practices to increase screening among this underserved population. Much community work needs to occur to make the language of screening gender-affirming for all participants.

We describe its association with mental health outcomes among Middle East and North African (MENA) residents of Michigan. Using a convenience sample of MENA residents in Michigan (n = 397), we conducted bivariate and multiple variable regression to describe the prevalence of deportation worry and examine the relationship between deportation worry and depressive symptoms (PHQ-4 scores). We found that 33% of our sample worried a loved one will be deported. Deportation worry was associated with worse mental health (p < 0.01).

Methods A narrative review was conducted to assess the literature on vulvar disease in WOC and evaluate the presence of images in this population. The search encompassed PubMed and OVID using relevant terms related to vulvar conditions and various groups of WOC. Case reports, as well as posters were excluded. Books on this topic were searched using these two search engines and Google, as well as the Taubman Health Sciences Library at the University of Michigan. This library contains numerous books on vulvar diseases commonly used by health care providers. Results This query identified 24 journal publications on vulvar diseases in WOC. Twenty-six books, commonly used by health care providers, were found to have been published with vulvar images of WOC. However, only 1 focused specifically on vulvar diseases in WOC. Conclusions There is a notable scarcity of articles and books addressing vulvar conditions specifically in WOC. This gap in literature limits our understanding of how these conditions may uniquely affect this demographic population. Additional research and resources are essential to effectively represent and meet the health needs of WOC.",10.1097/LGT.0000000000000869,University of Michigan Medical School,,57217234352.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 30 million Americans. Early management focused on blood pressure (BP) control decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Less than 40% of patients with CKD achieve recommended BP targets due to many barriers. These barriers include a lack of understanding of the implications of their diagnosis and how to optimise their health. This cluster randomised control trial hypothesises that the combination of early primary care CKD education, and motivational interviewing (MI)-based health coach support, will improve patient behaviours aligned with BP control by increasing patient knowledge, self-efficacy and motivation. The results will aid in sustainable interventions for future patient-centric education and coaching support to improve quality and outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5. Outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5 receiving the intervention will be compared with similar patients within a control group. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) and systems methodologies will be used to optimise resource neutrality and leverage existing technology to support implementation and future dissemination. The innovative approach of this research focuses on the importance of a multidisciplinary team, including off-site patient coaching, that can intervene early in the CKD care continuum by supporting patients with education and coaching. Methods and analysis We will test impact of BP control when clinician-delivered education is followed by 12 months of MI-based health coaching. We will compare outcomes in 350 patients with CKD stages 3-5 between intervention and control groups in primary care. CQI and systems methodologies will optimise education and coaching for future implementation and dissemination. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Boards (IRBMED) HUM00136011, HUM00150672 and SITE00000092 and the results of the study will be published on ClinicalTrials.gov, in peer-reviewed journals, as well as conference abstracts, posters and presentations.

Methods: Sixty-two African American men and women completed the study. Participants were invited to attend 24 weekly, consecutive, diabetes self-management support/education groups. The flow of the weekly group sessions was guided by questions and concerns of the patients. Baseline and 6-month follow-up metabolic functioning, lipid profiles, cardiovascular functioning, and self-care behaviors were assessed. Results: Ninety percent (n = 56) of the sample attended at least 1 session; 40% attended at least 12 or more sessions. Paired t tests found significant improvements in body mass index (P < .001), total cholesterol (P < .01), high-density lipoprotein (P < .05), and low-density lipoprotein (P < .001). Significant increases were also found for self-care behaviors (P < .05). Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that participation in this weekly problem-based, self-management support intervention can yield diabetes-related health benefits.",10.1177/0145721704273231,University of Michigan Medical School,,57217234352.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Recent attention and focus on, antiracism training in health care has potential to accelerate our path to social justice and achieve health equity on a national scale. However, theoretical frameworks and empirical data have yet to emerge that explain the uptake of antiracism trainings and their efficacy. Objective: This goal of this study was to test hypotheses regarding uptake of antiracism training in Family Medicine departments using Diffusion of Innovation Theory. Methods: In 2021, we incorporated 10 survey items in the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance's national omnibus survey for Department of Family Medicine Chairs (n = 104). We used DOI (Diffusion of Innovation) attributes (ie, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability) as a guiding framework to assess perceived innovation of antiracism training. We also evaluated the mode of training (eg, didactic, experiential) and whether any subsequent policy or practice-level antiracist actions occurred. We used c2 tests to examine associations between DOI attributes and antiracist actions; and logistic regression to determine odds of association. Results: Ninety-two percent of respondents indicated antiracism training was happening in their department. Relative advantage, compatibility and observability were positively associated with antiracist actions, P < .05. Perceived relative advantage was associated with implementation of antiracist action (OR 1.94, 1.27-2.99). Complexity and trialability were not statistically significantly associated with action. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence of DOIs influence on antiracism uptake in Departments of Family Medicine. We believe our findings can facilitate the future implementation of antiracism training activities and actionable antiracist policies and practices.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.04.210471,University of Rochester Medical Center,,57217234352.0,

Traditional grading systems do not accurately assess lesion severity because colposcopic impression alone is unreliable for diagnosis. The likelihood of finding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher increases when two or more cervical biopsies are performed. Excisional and ablative methods have similar treatment outcomes for the eradication of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. However, diagnostic excisional methods, including loop electrosurgical excision procedure and cold knife conization, are associated with an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes, such as preterm labor and low birth weight. Methods of endometrial assessment have a high sensitivity for detecting endometrial carcinoma and benign causes of uterine bleeding without unnecessary procedures. Endometrial biopsy can reliably detect carcinoma involving a large portion of the endometrium, but is suboptimal for diagnosing focal lesions. A 3- to 4-mm cutoff for endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasonography yields the highest sensitivity to exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women. Saline infusion sonohysteroscopy can differentiate globally thickened endometrium amenable to endometrial biopsy from focal abnormalities best assessed by hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy with directed biopsy is the most sensitive and specific method of diagnosing endometrial carcinoma, other than hysterectomy. © 2013 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Michigan Medicine,,57217234352.0,

Objectives: This quality improvement intervention was designed to improve HTN control among community-dwelling adults through collaboration between patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) within an academic medical center and chain community pharmacies. Methods: Four PCMH sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan that were in close proximity to two Meijer pharmacies participated in this study between September 2016 and March 2017, which compared HTN outcomes for patients seen at two community pharmacies where the pharmacists received training on HTN management for patients who received usual care at their PCMH. The primary outcome was percent of patients who met their blood pressure (BP) goal of either <140/90 mmHg or < 150/90 mmHg compared with matched controls who received usual care at the PCMH. Secondary outcomes included number of medication recommendations made, percent of recommendations accepted by the primary care provider (PCP), and patient satisfaction. Results: Patients who received care at the community pharmacy (n = 155) had a higher rate of BP control at 3 months than matched controls (61.8% vs 47.7%, P = 0.013). A total of 29 medication recommendations were made by community pharmacists and 26 were accepted by the PCP. Nearly 95% of patients rated the care they received as excellent or very good and over 95% stated that they would recommend the pharmacist at the Meijer pharmacy to their family and friends. Conclusion: Patients who received HTN management services as part of a collaboration between an academic medical center and chain community pharmacy were significantly more likely to have controlled BP at 3 months compared with matched controls who received standard care. This model shows promise as being a strategy to expand access to care for patients while being mutually beneficial for community pharmacies and health systems.",10.1002/jac5.1158,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,57217234352.0,1413762353.0

The order of testing may affect performance on later tests. One hundred and fifty patients with >3 months of back pain disability underwent a multidisciplinary Spine Team Assessment involving Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Pain Psychology, and Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor assessments at a university spine clinic. Seventeen back healthy volunteers performed the physical component of the assessment. For the volunteers the order of testing was randomized to OT tests first or PT test first, with 0.5 h rest between the tests. For patients the order of testing was arbitrarily set by an alternating schedule, with 1 h psychological testing between the two components. For both the patients and volunteers, among the 14 test components, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in performance with order of testing. This held true for the subgroup of patients who put out good cardiac effort. Volunteers performed better than patients on all individual tests (p < 0.001). Results suggest that the order of physical testing during a Spine Team Assessment does not affect test performance either in chronic low back disabled patients or in volunteers.",10.1023/A:1022504032299,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,57217234352.0,

A 32-year-old HIV-negative woman presented with a 6-month history of a vulvar pseudotumor that had been unresponsive to oral acyclovir and valacyclovir, as well as topical imiquimod. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a multidrug regimen for vulvar pseudotumor herpes infection in an HIV-negative patient. Methods: Histology revealed multinucleated giant cells, consistent with a herpes infection. The patient's herpes simplex virus type 2 was resistant to acyclovir. Immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide and topical imiquimod) were started. Results: The lesion enlarged after 6 weeks of treatment. Topical cidofovir 1% gel was added. There was gradual decrease in the pseudotumor size. After 7 months, the Pseudotumor had resolved. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of vulvar pseudotumoral herpes in an immunocompetent, HIV-negative patient. Oral thalidomide, in association with topical imiquimod and topical cidofovir, was effective in treating acyclovir-resistant pseudotumoral herpes of the vulva.",10.1016/j.ijwd.2021.06.002,Peking University First Hospital,,57217234352.0,1413762353.0

In this chapter, we offer a brief overview of MLM, discussing a number of advantages that the framework offers. We then demonstrate two useful MLMs for modeling change. First, we demonstrate the use of MLM to model trajectories for change over multiple measurement occasions via latent growth models. Second, we use an application of dyad-discrepancy MLM to model a difference in scores when assessing change over two measurement occasions. For both models, we discuss person-level and context-level variance and covariates.

Hearing AIDS (HAs), while helpful in addressing some of the outcomes of HL, are not covered by Medicare. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HA use is associated with health care costs and utilization in older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used nationally representative 2013-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to evaluate the use of HAs among 1336 adults aged 65 years or older with HL. An inverse propensity score weighting was applied to adjust for potential selection bias between older adults with and without HAs, all of whom reported having HL. The mean treatment outcomes of HA use onhealth care utilization and costs were estimated. EXPOSURES: Encounter with the US health care system. MAINOUTCOMES ANDMEASURES: (1) Total health care, Medicare, and out-of-pocket spending; (2) any emergency department (ED), inpatient, and office visit; and (3) number of ED visits, nights in hospital, and office visits. RESULTS: Of the 1336 individuals includedin the study, 574 (43.0%) were women; mean (SD) age was 77 (7) years. Adults without HAs (n = 734) were less educated, had lower income, and were more likely to be from minority subpopulations. The mean treatment outcomes of using HAs per participant were (1) higher total annual health care spending by $1125 (95% CI, $1114 to $1137) and higher out-of-pocket spending by $325 (95% CI, $322 to $326) but lower Medicare spending by $71 (95% CI, -$81 to -$62); (2) lower probability of any ED visit by 2 percentage points (PPs) (24% vs26%; 95% CI, -2% to -2%) and lower probability of any hospitalizationby 2 PPs (20% vs 22%; 95% CI, -3% to -1%) but higher probability of any office visit by 4 PPs (96% vs 92%; 95% CI, 4% to 4%); and (3) 1.40 more office visits (95% CI, 1.39 to 1.41) but 0.46 (5%) fewer number of hospital nights (95% CI, -0.47 to -0.44), with no association with the number of ED visits, if any (95% CI, 0.01 to 0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates the beneficial outcomes of use of HAs in reducing the probability of any ED visits and any hospitalizations and in reducing the number of nights in the hospital. Although use of HAs reduced total Medicare costs, it significantly increased total and out-of-pocket health care spending. This information may have implications for Medicare regarding covering HAs for patients with HL.",10.1001/jamaoto.2018.0273,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,
Elham Mahmoudi,"Burden of disease scenarios by state in the USA, 2022–50: a forecasting analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021",2024.0,The Lancet,Article,"forecasted usa, forecasting efforts, global burden, future health, disease study, disease scenarios, disease, forecasting life, mortality years, burden disease","2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. Methods: We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). Findings: Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78·3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78·1–78·5) in 2022 to 79·9 years (79·5–80·2) in 2035, and to 80·4 years (79·8–81·0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022–50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19·5% [6·9–34·1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3·8 additional years (3·6–4·0) of life expectancy and 4·1 additional years (3·9–4·3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0·4 additional years (0·3–0·6) of life expectancy and 0·6 additional years (0·5–0·8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0·4–0·5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd–64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12·4 million (11·3–13·5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1·4 million (0·7–2·2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2·1 million (1·3–2·9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1·2 million (0·9–1·5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing—as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation—are at stake.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used 2008 to 2016 national longitudinal claims data (based on office visit, inpatient, or outpatient healthcare encounters) from a large private payer. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to examine unadjusted disease-free survival and crude and adjusted Cox regression models to examine associations between HAs and time to diagnosis of three age-related/HL-associated conditions within 3 years of HL diagnosis. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, census divisions, and prior diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included 114 862 adults, aged 66 years and older, diagnosed with HL. MEASUREMENT: Diagnosis of (1) AD or dementia; (2) depression or anxiety; and (3) injurious falls. INTERVENTION: Use of HAs. RESULTS: Large sex and racial/ethnic differences exist in HA use. Approximately 11.3% of women vs 13.3% of men used HAs (95% confidence interval [CI] difference = −0.024 to −0.016). Approximately 13.6% of whites (95% CI = 0.13-0.14) vs 9.8% of blacks (95% CI = 0.09-0.11) and 6.5% of Hispanics (95% CI = 0.06-0.07) used HAs. The risk-adjusted hazard ratios of being diagnosed with AD/dementia, anxiety/depression, and injurious falls within 3 years after HL diagnosis, for those who used HAs vs those who did not, were 0.82 (95% CI = 0.76-0.89), 0.89 (95% CI = 0.86-0.93), and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HAs is associated with delayed diagnosis of AD, dementia, depression, anxiety, and injurious falls among older adults with HL. Although we have shown an association between use of HAs and reduced risk of physical and mental decline, randomized trials are needed to determine whether, and to what extent, the relationship is causal.

Yet, continuity of care in adults aging with congenital disability and the factors that contribute to care continuity are largely unknown. Using data from a national private administrative health claims database in the United States (2007–2018). we examined continuity of care in 8596 adults (mean age 48.6 years) with cerebral palsy or spina bifida. Logistic regression models analyzed how proximity to health care facilities, availability of care providers, and community socioeconomic context were associated with more continuous care. We found that adults aging with cerebral palsy or spina bifida saw a variety of different physician specialty types and generally had discontinuous care. Individuals who lived in areas with more hospitals and residential care facilities received more continuous care than those with limited access to these resources. Residence in more affluent areas was associated with receiving more fragmented care. Findings suggest that over and above individual factors, community healthcare resources and socioeconomic context serve as important factors to consider in understanding continuity of care patterns in adults aging with cerebral palsy or spina bifida.",10.3390/disabilities3020019,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,1856339.0
Elham Mahmoudi,Disparities in Morbidity After Spinal Cord Injury Across Insurance Types in the United States,2022.0,"Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Innovations, Quality & Outcomes",Article,Spinal Cord; Insurance; Spinal Cord; Insurance,"2022 The AuthorsObjective: To compare the prevalence and incidence of, and adjusted hazards for comorbidities among adults with traumatic spinal cord injuries (TSCIs) across insurance types (private vs governmental insurance) in the United States. Patients and Methods: Privately insured (N=9081) and Medicare (N=7645) beneficiaries with a diagnosis of TSCI were included. Prevalence and incidence estimates of common psychological, cardiometabolic, and musculoskeletal morbidities were compared at baseline and at 4-years after index diagnosis, respectively. Survival models were used to quantify hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes, controlling for insurance type, sociodemographic characteristics, and other comorbidities. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effects of insurance and race/ethnicity. Results: Adults with TSCIs on Medicare had a higher prevalence of any psychological (54.7% vs 35.4%), cardiometabolic (74.7% vs 70.1%), and musculoskeletal (72.8% vs 66.3%) morbidity than privately insured adults with TSCIs. Similarly, the 4-year incidences of most psychological (eg, depression: 37.6% [Medicare] vs 24.2% [private]), cardiometabolic (eg, type 2 diabetes: 22.5% [Medicare] vs 12.9% [private], and musculoskeletal (eg, osteoarthritis: 42.1% [Medicare] vs 34.6% [private]) morbidities were considerably higher among adults with TSCIs on Medicare. Adjusted survival models found that adults with TSCIs on Medicare had a greater hazard for developing psychological (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.31-1.50) and cardiometabolic (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.33) morbidities compared with privately insured adults with TSCI. There was evidence of both insurance and racial disparities. Conclusion: Adults with TSCIs on Medicare had significantly higher prevalence and risk for developing common physical and mental health comorbidities, compared with privately insured adults with TSCIs.",10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2022.04.004,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,1856339.0

Objective To examine national trends in disparities in access to health care and to identify the impact of physical disability and the personal factors that are associated with unmet health care needs, defined as self-reported ability to get medical care, dental care or prescription medications, among working age adults within the United States. Methods Logistic regression analysis of a nationally representative sample of adults ages 25-64 (n = 163,220) with and without physical disabilities, using pooled data from the 2002-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Results Individuals with physical disabilities have 75% (p < 0.0001), 57% (p < 0.0001), and 85% (p < 0.000) higher odds of having unmet medical, dental, and prescription medication needs, respectively. Sociodemographic and health factors were related to unmet needs in all three measures of access to care. In particular, being female, living at or near the poverty level, and lacking health insurance increased the odds of unmet health care needs. Predicted probabilities of unmet health care needs from 2002 to 2011 show persistent gaps between individuals with and without physical disabilities, with a growing gap in unmet dental care (p = 0.004). Conclusion Having physical disabilities increase the odds of unmet health care needs. This study has important policy and community program implications.

All right reserved.Background: Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with complications for both the mother and her infant including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, operative delivery, and long-term obesity. A healthy diet during pregnancy promotes healthy gestational weight gain and determines fetal epigenetic programming in infants that impacts risk for future chronic disease. Objective: This project will examine the impact of grocery delivery during pregnancy on the weight, diet, and health outcomes of young pregnant women and their infants. Methods: A three-arm randomized controlled trial design will be performed. A total of 855 young pregnant women, aged 14-24 years, from across the state of Michigan will be enrolled and randomized equally into the three study arms. Participants in arm one (control) will receive usual care from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); arm two will receive WIC plus biweekly grocery delivery; and arm three will receive WIC plus biweekly grocery and unsweetened beverage delivery. Weight will be assessed weekly during pregnancy, and total pregnancy weight gain will be categorized as above, below, or within guidelines. Additionally, dietary intake will be assessed at three time points (baseline, second trimester, and third trimester), and pregnancy outcomes will be extracted from medical records. The appropriateness of pregnancy weight gain, diet quality, and occurrence of poor outcomes will be compared between groups using standard practices for multinomial regression and confounder adjustment. Results: This study was funded in April 2021, data collection started in December 2021, and data collection is expected to be concluded in 2026. Conclusions: This study will test whether grocery delivery of healthy foods improves weight, diet, and pregnancy outcomes of young moms with low income. The findings will inform policies and practices that promote a healthy diet during pregnancy, which has multigenerational impacts on health.",10.2196/40568,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,1856339.0

All rights reserved.Hearing loss (HL) is common among individuals aged 50 and older and is associated with increased healthcare costs. Whether HL is associated with less access to healthcare is unclear. In this study, we examined the association between HL and access to medical care and prescription drugs among individuals 50+ with and without HL. We used nationally representative 2013-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, consisting of 1,977 adults with HL and 17,399 without. We applied an inverse propensity score weighting and regression modeling to adjust for any potential differences in health and socioeconomic conditions between the two groups. Adults with HL were more likely to be white, less educated, poorer, and with public insurance (p < 0.001). They were also likely to have hypertension, heart disease, stroke, emphysema, high cholesterol, diabetes, joint pain, and arthritis (p < 0.001). The odds of reporting unmet medical needs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-2.66), delay in getting medical needs met (OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.00-1.87), and having unfilled prescriptions (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.27-2.59) were higher among individuals with HL compared with their counterparts without HL. Individuals with HL have less access to care and prescription drugs.

Elham Mahmoudi,Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Identify Caregiver Availability for Patients with ADRD from Electronic Medical Records,2022.0,Alzheimer's and Dementia,Note,Medical Records; Language; Medical Records; Language,"2022 the Alzheimer's Association.Background: Prior literature has posited that caregiver availability can potentially prevent adverse health events such as hospital readmissions in the ADRD population. Identifying caregiver availability for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) can inform healthcare systems and hospital administrations on appropriate discharge planning. Caregiver availability is an important and influential domain in assessing risk of hospital readmissions. However, caregiver availability data is not systematically collected in our healthcare system. Our main objective was to use medical notes (from physicians, nurses, or social workers) to assess caregiver availability and types of caregivers for hospitalized patients with ADRD. Method: We used 2016-2019 telephone-encounter medical notes from a single institution. Rule-based natural language processing (NLP) was used to develop an algorithm to identify whether the patient (1) resides at home; (2) resides at an institution; (3) has a formal caregiver; and (4) has an informal caregiver. We evaluated the data at the patient level. We used chart abstraction as the “gold standard,” and examined the validity of the algorithm for both training (n = 749) and test sets (n = 227). Result: The result from our test set indicated a high level of accuracy and reliability for identifying an informal caregiver (F1 = 0.942; accuracy = 0.947, sensitivity = 0.970, and specificity = 0.928). Identifying whether the patient lived at an institution was the least reliable measure (F1 = 0.638, accuracy = 0.899, sensitivity = 0.512, specificity = 0.978). The most common causes of misclassifications were: (1) incomplete or misspelled names of the facilities; (2) past/uncertain/undecided situations; (3) lack of specificity; (4) use of uncommon abbreviations; and (5) irregular use of templates. Conclusion: Our NLP algorithm was able to identify whether the patient lived at home vs. an institution and whether the patient had a formal or informal caregiver. There is merit in continuing the NLP approach to identify more granular, caregiver-related information (e.g., type, hours available, etc.). More effort is needed towards generalizing the algorithm. This information can be used by other healthcare systems to detect ADRD patients who do not have a caregiver at home and may be at risk of adverse events including readmission.",10.1002/alz.064646,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,6953599.0

Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of and adjusted hazards for musculoskeletal (MSK) morbidities among adults living with and without CP or SB. Methods: A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted among adults living with (n = 15,302) CP or SB and without (n = 1,935,480) CP or SB. Incidence estimates of common MSK morbidities were compared at 4 years of enrollment. Survival models were used to quantify unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for incident MSK morbidities. The analyses were performed in 2019 to 2020. Results: Adults living with CP or SB had a higher 4-year incidence of any MSK morbidity (55.3% vs. 39.0%) as compared to adults without CP or SB, and differences were to a clinically meaningful extent. Fully adjusted survival models demonstrated that adults with CP or SB had a greater hazard for all MSK disorders; this ranged from hazard ratio (HR) 1.40 (95% CI, 1.33 to 1.48) for myalgia to HR 3.23 (95% CI, 3.09 to 3.38) for sarcopenia and weakness. Conclusion: Adults with CP or SB have a significantly higher incidence of and risk for common MSK morbidities as compared to adults without CP or SB.

We estimated the prevalence of overweight and obesity from 1990 to 2021 with forecasts to 2050 for children and adolescents (aged 5–24 years) and adults (aged ≥25 years) at the national level. Additionally, we derived state-specific estimates and projections for older adolescents (aged 15–24 years) and adults for all 50 states and Washington, DC. Methods: In this analysis, self-reported and measured anthropometric data were extracted from 134 unique sources, which included all major national surveillance survey data. Adjustments were made to correct for self-reporting bias. For individuals older than 18 years, overweight was defined as having a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 30 kg/m2 and obesity was defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher, and for individuals younger than 18 years definitions were based on International Obesity Task Force criteria. Historical trends of overweight and obesity prevalence from 1990 to 2021 were estimated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. A generalised ensemble modelling approach was then used to derive projected estimates up to 2050, assuming continuation of past trends and patterns. All estimates were calculated by age and sex at the national level, with estimates for older adolescents (aged 15–24 years) and adults aged (≥25 years) also calculated for 50 states and Washington, DC. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of the posterior distributions of the respective estimates. Findings: In 2021, an estimated 15·1 million (95% UI 13·5–16·8) children and young adolescents (aged 5–14 years), 21·4 million (20·2–22·6) older adolescents (aged 15–24 years), and 172 million (169–174) adults (aged ≥25 years) had overweight or obesity in the USA. Texas had the highest age-standardised prevalence of overweight or obesity for male adolescents (aged 15–24 years), at 52·4% (47·4–57·6), whereas Mississippi had the highest for female adolescents (aged 15–24 years), at 63·0% (57·0–68·5). Among adults, the prevalence of overweight or obesity was highest in North Dakota for males, estimated at 80·6% (78·5–82·6), and in Mississippi for females at 79·9% (77·8–81·8). The prevalence of obesity has outpaced the increase in overweight over time, especially among adolescents. Between 1990 and 2021, the percentage change in the age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased by 158·4% (123·9–197·4) among male adolescents and 185·9% (139·4–237·1) among female adolescents (15–24 years). For adults, the percentage change in prevalence of obesity was 123·6% (112·4–136·4) in males and 99·9% (88·8–111·1) in females. Forecast results suggest that if past trends and patterns continue, an additional 3·33 million children and young adolescents (aged 5–14 years), 3·41 million older adolescents (aged 15–24 years), and 41·4 million adults (aged ≥25 years) will have overweight or obesity by 2050. By 2050, the total number of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity will reach 43·1 million (37·2–47·4) and the total number of adults with overweight and obesity will reach 213 million (202–221). In 2050, in most states, a projected one in three adolescents (aged 15–24 years) and two in three adults (≥25 years) will have obesity. Although southern states, such as Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Kentucky, are forecast to continue to have a high prevalence of obesity, the highest percentage changes from 2021 are projected in states such as Utah for adolescents and Colorado for adults. Interpretation: Existing policies have failed to address overweight and obesity. Without major reform, the forecasted trends will be devastating at the individual and population level, and the associated disease burden and economic costs will continue to escalate. Stronger governance is needed to support and implement a multifaceted whole-system approach to disrupt the structural drivers of overweight and obesity at both national and local levels. Although clinical innovations should be leveraged to treat and manage existing obesity equitably, population-level prevention remains central to any intervention strategies, particularly for children and adolescents.

Health Services Research published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Health Research and Educational Trust.Objective: To develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that identifies social determinants of health (SDoH), including housing, transportation, food, and medication insecurities, social isolation, abuse, neglect, or exploitation, and financial difficulties for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs). Data Sources and Study Setting: We leveraged 1000 medical notes randomly selected from 7401 emergency department and inpatient social worker notes generated between 2015 and 2019 for 231 unique patients diagnosed with ADRD at Michigan Medicine. Study Design: We developed a rule-based NLP algorithm for the identification of seven domains of SDoH noted above. We also compared the rule-based algorithm with deep learning and regularized logistic regression approaches. These models were compared using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). All notes were split into 700 notes for training NLP algorithms, and 300 notes for validation. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Social worker notes used in this study were extracted from the Michigan Medicine EHR database. Principal Findings: Of the 700 notes for training, F1 and AUC for the rule-based algorithm were at least 0.94 and 0.95, respectively, for all SDoH categories. Of the 300 notes for validation, F1 and AUC were at least 0.80 and 0.97, respectively, for all SDoH except housing and medication insecurities. The deep learning and regularized logistic regression algorithms had unsatisfactory performance. Conclusions: The rule-based algorithm can accurately extract SDoH information in all seven domains of SDoH except housing and medication insecurities. Findings from the algorithm can be used by clinicians and social workers to proactively address social needs of patients with ADRD and other vulnerable patient populations.",10.1111/1475-6773.14210,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,1856339.0

Patients and Methods: Beneficiaries were included if they had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code for MS (n=9815) from a national private insurance claims database (Clinformatics Data Mart; OptumInsight). Adults without MS were also included (n=1,474,232) as a control group. Incidence estimates of common cardiometabolic diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and psychological morbidities were compared at 5 years of continuous enrollment. Survival models were used to quantify unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for incident morbidities. Results: Adults with MS had a higher incidence of any common cardiometabolic disease (51.6% [2663 of 5164] vs 36.4% [328,690 of 904,227]), musculoskeletal disorder (68.8% [3411 of 4959] vs 47.5% [512,422 of 1,077,737]), and psychological morbidity (49.4% [3305 of 6691] vs 30.8% [380,893 of 1,235,388]) than adults without MS, and differences were clinically meaningful (all P<.001). Fully adjusted survival models revealed that adults with MS had a greater risk for any (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.43) and all (HR, 1.19 to 1.48) common cardiometabolic diseases, any (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.53 to 1.64) and all (HR, 1.22 to 2.77) musculoskeletal disorders, and any (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.51 to 1.62) and all (HR, 1.20 to 2.51) but one (impulse control disorders) psychological morbidity. Conclusion: Adults with MS have a significantly higher risk for development of common cardiometabolic diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and psychological morbidities (all P<.001) than adults without MS.

We hypothesized a greater PPH risk among people with a sensory loss (hearing, vision, and dual) compared with controls. Patients and Methods: Using 2007-2016 Medicare fee-for-service claims, this retrospective, case-control study examined the risk of PPH among adults aged 65 years and older with hearing, vision, and dual sensory loss compared with their corresponding counterparts without sensory loss (between June 1, 2022, and February 1, 2023). We ran 3 step-in regression models for the 3 case and control cohorts examining PPH risk. Our generalized linear regression models controlled for age, sex, race, Elixhauser comorbidity count, rurality, neighborhood characteristics, and the number of primary care physicians and hospitals at the county level. Results: People with vision (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.21; 95% CI, 0.84-0.87) and dual sensory loss (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.40) showed a higher PPH risks than their corresponding controls. For people with hearing loss, our unadjusted models showed a higher PPH risk (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.38-1.43) but after adjustment, hearing loss showed a protective association against PPH risk (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.84-0.87). Moreover, in all models, annual wellness visits reduced the PPH risk by about half (eg, aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.52-0.55), whereas living in disadvantaged neighborhood increased the PPH risk (eg, aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.10-1.15) for cases and controls. Conclusion: People with vision and dual sensory loss were at greater PPH risk. This study has important health policy implications in reducing PPH and is indicative of a need for more incentivized and systematic approaches to facilitating the use of preventive care, particularly among older adults living in a disadvantaged neighborhood.",10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2023.06.004,Tulane University School of Medicine,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,1856339.0

We hypothesize that PPH risk is greater among adults with CP/SB compared with the general population. Patients and Methods: Using January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2017, national private administrative claims data (OptumInsight) in the United States, we identified adults with CP/SB (n=10,617). Adults without CP/SB were included as controls (n=1,443,716). To ensure a similar proportion in basic demographics, we propensity-matched our controls with cases in age and sex (n=10,617). Generalized estimating equation models were applied to examine the risk of CP/SB on PPHs. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, health indicators, US Census Division data, and socioeconomic variables. Adjusted odds ratios were compared within a 4-year follow-up. Results: Adults with CP/SB had higher risk for any PPH (odds ratio [OR], 4.10; 95% CI, 2.31 to 7.31), and PPHs due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma (OR, 1.85; CI, 1.23 to 2.76), pneumonia (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.06 to 4.39), and urinary tract infection (OR, 6.48; 95% CI, 3.91 to 10.75). Cases and controls who had an annual wellness visit had lower PPH risk (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.67); similarly, adults with CP/SB who had an annual wellness visit compared with adults with CP/SB who did not had lower odds of PPH (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.94). Conclusion: Adults with pediatric-onset disabilities are at a greater risk for PPHs.

All rights reserved.PURPOSE We undertook a study to examine national trends in potentially preventable hospitalizations—those for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions that could have been avoided if patients had timely access to primary care—across 3,200 counties and various subpopulations of older adults in the United States. METHODS We used 2010-2014 Medicare claims data to examine trends in potentially preventable hospitalizations among beneficiaries aged 65 years and older and developed heat maps to examine county-level variation. We used a generalized estimating equation and adjusted the model for demographics, comorbidities, dual eligibility (Medicare and Medicaid), ZIP code–level income, and county-level number of primary care physicians and hospitals. RESULTS Across the 3,200 study counties, potentially preventable hospitalizations decreased in 327 counties, increased in 123 counties, and did not change in the rest. At the population level, the adjusted rate of potentially preventable hospitalizations declined by 3.45 percentage points from 19.42% (95% CI, 18.4%-20.5%) in 2010 to 15.97% (95% CI, 15.3%-16.6%) in 2014; it declined by 2.93, 2.87, and 3.33 percentage points among White, Black, and Hispanic patients to 14.96% (95% CI, 14.67%-15.24%), 17.92% (95% CI, 17.27%-18.58%), and 17.10% (95% CI, 16.25%-18.0%), respectively. Similarly, the rate for dually eligible patients fell by 3.71 percentage points from 21.62% (95% CI, 20.5%-22.8%) in 2010 to 17.91% (95% CI, 17.2%-18.7%) in 2014. (P <.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS During 2010-2014, rates of potentially preventable hospitalization did not change in the majority of counties. At the population level, although the rate declined among all subpopulations, dually eligible patients and Black and Hispanic patients continued to have substantially higher rates compared with non–dually eligible and White patients, respectively.",10.1370/afm.2605,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,

Potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) is an important marker for access to, and receipt of timely care. However, few national studies have examined PPH risk in people with MS or considered the role of preventive care in reducing PPH risk among this patient population. Our objective was to examine PPH risk among adults with MS compared with their counterparts without MS. Methods: Optum® Clinformatics® Data Mart (2007–2017) was used to identify 6198 individuals with an MS diagnosis and their propensity-score matched counterparts without MS. Diagnostic and procedural codes were used to identify the presence of preventive hospitalizations, which were defined as quality indicators by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) during the 4-year follow-up period since the diagnosis of MS. Information on receipt of preventive services and office visits was also extracted. Adjusted generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between MS diagnosis and PPHs. To examine the role of preventive services on odds of PPH amongst people with MS, we reported the adjusted marginal odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The rate of any PPH among people with MS was double that of those without MS (131.6 vs 62.5 per 10,000). We identified higher odds of specific PPH indicators among people with MS compared to those without. Individuals with MS had 65% higher odds of hospitalization for pneumonia (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.30), with similar significant findings observed for urinary tract infections (OR=4.90, 95% CI: 2.51, 9.57). In MS patients, receipt of preventive services, namely cholesterol screening (OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.95) and annual wellness visits were associated with lower odds of any PPH (OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.76). Conclusion: People with MS were at a higher risk for PPHs compared with their counterparts without MS. Use of appropriate preventive services reduced the risk of PPH among the general population and among those with MS. More efforts are needed to encourage and facilitate the use of preventive care among people with MS. Receipt of timely and appropriate preventive care in this population may reduce the risk for PPH.",10.1016/j.msard.2022.104105,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,

Design: Cohort study. Setting: Using 2007-2017 U.S. claims data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, we identified adults (18 years or older) with diagnosis of TSCI (n=5380). Adults without TSCI diagnosis were included as controls (n=1,074,729). Using age and sex, we matched individuals with and without TSCI (n=5173) with propensity scores to address potential selection bias. Generalized linear regression was applied to examine the risk of TSCI on PPHs. Models were adjusted for age; sex; race and ethnicity; Elixhauser comorbidity count; any cardiometabolic, psychological, and musculoskeletal chronic conditions; U.S. Census Division; socioeconomic variables; and use of certain preventative care services. Adjusted odds ratios were compared within a 4-year follow-up period. Participants: Adults with and without TSCI (N=5,173). Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcomes Measures: Any PPH and specific PPHs Results: Adults with TSCI had higher risk for any PPH (odds ratio [OR], 1.67; 95% CI,1.20-2.32), as well as PPHs because of urinary tract infection (UTI) (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 2.47-5.79), hypertension (OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.54-9.21), diabetes long-term complications (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.34-4.80), and pneumonia (OR, 1.71; 95% CI. 1.21-2.41). Annual wellness visit was associated with reduced PPH risk compared with cases and controls without annual wellness visit (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46-0.71) and among people with TSCI (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.86) compared with cases without annual wellness visit. Conclusions: Adults with TSCI are at a heightened risk for PPH. They are also more susceptible to certain PPHs such as UTIs, pneumonia, and heart failure. Encouraging the use of preventative or health-promoting services, especially for respiratory and urinary outcomes, may reduce PPHs among adults with TSCI.",10.1016/j.apmr.2021.12.004,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America. All rights reserved.Objectives: Examine racial/ethnic disparities in 30-day readmission and frequent hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries with dementia in traditional Medicare (TM) versus Medicare Advantage (MA). Methods: In this case-control study, we used 2018-2019 TM and MA claims data. Participants included individuals 65+ with 2 years of continuous enrollment, diagnosis of dementia, a minimum of 4 office visits in 2018, and at least 1 hospitalization in 2019, (cases: TM [n=36,656]; controls: MA [n=29,366]). We conducted matching based on health-need variables and applied generalized linear models adjusting for demographics, health-related variables, and healthcare encounters. Results: TM was associated with higher odds of 30-day readmission (OR=1.07 [CI: 1.02 to 1.12]) and frequent hospitalizations (OR=1.10 [CI: 1.06 to 1.14]) compared to MA. Hispanic and Black enrollees in TM had higher odds of frequent hospitalizations compared with Hispanic and Black enrollees in MA, respectively (OR=1.35 [CI: 1.19 to 1.54]) and (OR=1.26 [CI: 1.13 to 1.40]). MA was associated with lower Hispanic-White and Black-White disparities in frequent hospitalizations by 5.8 (CI: -0.09 to -0.03) and 4.4 percentage points (PP; CI: -0.07 to -0.02), respectively. For 30-day readmission, there was no significant difference between Black enrollees in TM and MA (OR=1.04 [CI: 0.92 to 1.18]), but Hispanic enrollees in TM had higher odds of readmission than Hispanics in MA (OR=1.23 [CI: 1.06 to 1.43]). MA was associated with a lower Hispanic-White disparity in readmission by 1.9 PP (CI: -0.004 to -0.01). Discussion: MA versus TM was associated with lower risks of 30-day readmission and frequent hospitalizations. Moreover, MA substantially reduced Hispanic-White and Black-White disparities in frequent hospitalizations compared with TM.",10.1093/geronb/gbae078,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,
Elham Mahmoudi,Readmission Rates and Episode Costs for Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias Across Hospitals in a Statewide Collaborative,2023.0,JAMA Network Open,Article,Dementia; Dementia,"2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.Importance: There has been a paucity of research examining the risk and cost of readmission among patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) after a planned hospitalization for a broad set of medical and surgical procedures. Objective: To examine 30-day readmission rates and episode costs, including readmission costs, for patients with ADRD compared with their counterparts without ADRD across Michigan hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used 2012 to 2017 Michigan Value Collaborative data across different medical and surgical services stratified by ADRD diagnosis. A total of 66676 admission episodes of care that occurred between January 1, 2012, and June 31, 2017, were identified for patients with ADRD using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes for ADRD, along with 656235 admission episodes in patients without ADRD. Using a generalized linear model framework, this study risk adjusted, price standardized, and performed episode payment winsorization. Payments were risk adjusted for age, sex, Hierarchical Condition Categories, insurance type, and prior 6-month payments. Selection bias was accounted for using multivariable logistic regression with propensity score matching without replacement using calipers. Data analysis was performed from January to December 2019. Exposure: Presence of ADRD. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were 30-day readmission rate at the patient and county levels, 30-day readmission cost, and 30-day total episode cost across 28 medical and surgical services. Results: The study included 722911 hospitalization episodes, of which 66676 were related to patients with ADRD (mean [SD] age, 83.4 [8.6] years; 42 439 [63.6%] female) and 656235 were related to patients without ADRD (mean [SD] age, 66.0 [15.4] years; 351 246 [53.5%] female). After propensity score matching, 58629 hospitalization episodes were included for each group. Readmission rates were 21.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-21.8%) for patients with ADRD and 14.7% (95% CI, 14.4%-15.0%) for patients without ADRD (difference, 6.75 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.31-7.19 percentage points). Cost of 30-day readmission was $467 higher (95% CI of difference, $289-$645) among patients with ADRD ($8378; 95% CI, $8263-$8494) than those without ($7912; 95% CI, $7776-$8047). Across all 28 service lines examined, total 30-day episode costs were $2794 higher for patients with ADRD vs patients without ADRD ($22371 vs $19578; 95% CI of difference, $2668-$2919). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with ADRD had higher readmission rates and overall readmission and episode costs than their counterparts without ADRD. Hospitals may need to be better equipped to care for patients with ADRD, especially in the postdischarge period. Considering that any type of hospitalization may put patients with ADRD at a high risk of 30-day readmission, judicious preoperative assessment, postoperative discharge, and care planning are strongly advised for this vulnerable patient population.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.2109,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,6953599.0
Elham Mahmoudi,Risk of early- and late-onset Alzheimer disease and related dementia in adults with cerebral palsy,2022.0,Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology,Article,Ear; Dementia; Adult,"2021 Mac Keith Press.Aim: To examine the risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementia (ADRD) among adults with cerebral palsy (CP). Method: Using administrative insurance claims data for 2007 to 2017 in the USA, we identified adults (45y or older) with a diagnosis of CP (n=5176). Adults without a diagnosis of CP were included as a typically developing comparison group (n=1 119 131). Using age, sex, ethnicity, other demographic variables, and a set of chronic morbidities, we propensity-matched individuals with and without CP (n=5038). Cox survival models were used to estimate ADRD risk within a 3-year follow up. Results: The unadjusted incidence of ADRD was 9 and 2.4 times higher among cohorts of adults 45 to 64 years (1.8%) and 65 years and older (4.8%) with CP than the respective unmatched individuals without CP (0.2% and 2.0% among 45–64y and 65y or older respectively). Fully adjusted survival models indicated that adults with CP had a greater hazard for ADRD (among 45–64y: unmatched hazard ratio 7.48 [95% confidence interval {CI} 6.05–9.25], matched hazard ratio 4.73 [95% CI 2.72–8.29]; among 65y or older: unmatched hazard ratio 2.21 [95% CI 1.95–2.51], matched hazard ratio 1.73 [1.39–2.15]). Interpretation: Clinical guidelines for early screening of cognitive function among individuals with CP need updating, and preventative and/or therapeutic services should be used to reduce the risk of ADRD.",10.1111/dmcn.15044,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,

Methods: Data are from the Health and Retirement Study (2006–2018 waves; n = 15,567). We inflation-adjusted all health care costs using the 2021 consumer price index. Geographic context and dementia status were the main exposure variables. We applied multivariate two-part generalized linear models and adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics. Results: Rural residents had higher total health care costs, regardless of dementia status. Total health care costs were $850 higher in rural ($2,640) compared to urban ($1,789) areas (p <.001). Out-of-pocket costs were $870 higher in rural ($2,677) compared to urban ($1,806) areas (p <.001). Dementia status was not an effect modifier.

Elham Mahmoudi,The intersection of disability and healthcare disparities: A conceptual framework,2015.0,Disability and Rehabilitation,Review,Work; Access to care; Disability; Healthcare access; Healthcare disparities; Healthcare quality; Quality of care,"2014 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.Purpose: This article provides a conceptual framework for understanding healthcare disparities experienced by individuals with disabilities. While health disparities are the result of factors deeply rooted in culture, life style, socioeconomic status, and accessibility of resources, healthcare disparities are a subset of health disparities that reflect differences in access to and quality of healthcare and can be viewed as the inability of the healthcare system to adequately address the needs of specific population groups. Methods: This article uses a narrative method to identify and critique the main conceptual frameworks that have been used in analyzing disparities in healthcare access and quality, and evaluating those frameworks in the context of healthcare for individuals with disabilities. Specific models that are examined include the Aday and Anderson Model, the Grossman Utility Model, the Institute of Medicine (IOM)'s models of Access to Healthcare Services and Healthcare Disparities, and the Cultural Competency model. Results: While existing frameworks advance understandings of disparities in healthcare access and quality, they fall short when applied to individuals with disabilities. Specific deficits include a lack of attention to cultural and contextual factors (Aday and Andersen framework), unrealistic assumptions regarding equal access to resources (Grossman's utility model), lack of recognition or inclusion of concepts of structural accessibility (IOM model of Healthcare Disparities) and exclusive emphasis on supply side of the healthcare equation to improve healthcare disparities (Cultural Competency model). In response to identified gaps in the literature and short-comings of current conceptualizations, an integrated model of disability and healthcare disparities is put forth. Conclusion: We analyzed models of access to care and disparities in healthcare to be able to have an integrated and cohesive conceptual framework that could potentially address issues related to access to healthcare among individuals with disabilities. The Model of Healthcare Disparities and Disability (MHDD) provides a framework for conceptualizing how healthcare disparities impact disability and specifically, how a mismatch between personal and environmental factors may result in reduced healthcare access and quality, which in turn may lead to reduced functioning, activity and participation among individuals with impairments and chronic health conditions. Researchers, health providers, policy makers and community advocate groups who are engaged in devising interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities would benefit from the discussions.Implications for RehabilitationEvaluates the main models of healthcare disparity and disability to create an integrated framework.Provides a comprehensive conceptual model of healthcare disparity that specifically targets issues related to individuals with disabilities.Conceptualizes how personal and environmental factors interact to produce disparities in access to healthcare and healthcare quality.Recognizes and targets modifiable factors to reduce disparities between and within individuals with disabilities.",10.3109/09638288.2014.938176,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Methods: Using 2008–2016 Medicare and commercial claims data, we compared adults with the same disability enrolled in TM vs. commercial insurance [Medicare: n = 21,599 (CP/SB); n = 7,605 (MS); n = 4,802 (TSCI); commercial: n = 11,306 (CP/SB); n = 6,254 (MS); n = 5,265 (TSCI)]. We applied generalized estimating equations to address repeated measures, comparing cases with controls. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. Results: Compared with commercial insurance, enrolling in TM reduced the odds of using preventive services. For example, adjusted odds ratios (OR) of annual wellness visits in TM vs. commercial insurance were 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28–0.34), 0.32 (95% CI: 0.28–0.37), and 0.19 (95% CI: 0.17–0.22) among adults with CP/SB, TSCI, and MS, respectively. Furthermore, PPH risks were higher in TM vs. commercial insurance. ORs of PPH in TM vs. commercial insurance were 1.50 (95% CI: 1.18–1.89), 1.83 (95% CI: 1.40–2.41), and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.66–3.22) among adults with CP/SB, TSCI, and MS, respectively. Moreover, dual-eligible adults had higher odds of PPH compared with non-dual-eligible adults [CP/SB: OR = 1.47 (95% CI: 1.25–1.72); TSCI: OR = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.35–1.92), and MS: OR = 1.80 (95% CI: 1.55–2.10)]. Conclusions: TM, relative to commercial insurance, was associated with lower receipt of preventive care and higher PPH risk among adults with disability.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2024.102663,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,
Elham Mahmoudi,Racial and Ethnic Inequities in Use of Preventive Services Among Privately Insured Adults With a Pediatric-Onset Disability,2022.0,Annals of Family Medicine,Article,cerebral palsy; disability; health care disparity; preventive; spina bifida,"2022, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc. All rights reserved.PURPOSE Cerebral palsy (CP) and spina bifida (SB) are pediatric-onset disabilities. Adults living with CP/SB are in a greater need of preventive care than the general population due to their increased risk for chronic diseases. Our objective was to compare White/Black and White/Hispanic inequities in the use of preventive services. METHODS Using 2007-2017 private claims data, we identified a total of 11,635 adults with CP/BS. Of these, 8,935 were White, 1,457 Black, and 1,243 Hispanic. We matched health-related variables (age, sex, comorbid conditions) between White adults and those in each minority subpopulation. Generalized estimating equations were used and all models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, income, education, and US Census divisions. Outcomes of interest were: (1) any office visit; (2) any physical/occupational therapy; (3) wellness visit; (4) bone density screening; (5) cholesterol screening; and (6) diabetes screening. RESULTS The rate of recommended services for all subpopulations of adults with CP/SB was low. Compared with White adults, Hispanic adults had lower odds of wellness visits (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.53-0.96) but higher odds of diabetes screening (OR = 1.48, 95% CI, 1.13-1.93). Compared with White adults, Black adults had lower odds of wellness visits (OR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.24-1.00) and bone density screening (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.31-0.95). CONCLUSIONS Preventive service use among adults with CP/SB was low. Large White-minority disparities in wellness visits were observed. Interventions to address physical accessibility, adoption of telehealth, and increased clinician education may mitigate these disparities, particularly if initiatives target minority populations.",10.1370/afm.2849,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,55033905300.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Musculoskeletal problems are common in primary care, yet many family physicians lack confidence and competence in this area. The Advanced Primary Care Orthopedics (APCO) course utilizes hands-on physical exam instruction, interactive cases, and intentional repetition to teach anatomy, a standardized exam, and important diagnoses. This study assesses the effectiveness of APCO in improving musculoskeletal exam knowledge and confidence. METHODS: APCO is a 1.5-day course taught annually to family medicine residents. A 1-day course has also been conducted as a preconference workshop targeting faculty physicians. Participants completed pre-and postcourse assessments to evaluate their knowledge and confidence with the musculoskeletal exam. We compared results using mean differences with paired t-test statistics. RESULTS: In the 2018 and 2019 resident courses, 23 of 30 participants (77%) completed the knowledge assessment and 25 of 30 participants (83%) completed the confidence assessment. Knowledge assessment scores improved by 9.5 points (P<.05) after completion of the course. Confidence in the musculoskeletal exam, as assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (1–not confident at all; 5–very confident), improved from 2.2 to 3.8 after the course (P<.05). In the 2018 preconference workshop, 23 of 36 participants (64%) completed the confidence assessment. Confidence increased from 2.17 to 3.61 (P<.05) after course completion. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the APCO course increased short-term musculoskeletal knowledge and confidence. APCO has many potential applications for residency curriculums, faculty development, and continuing medical education.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.362716,Swedish First Hill Family Medicine Residency,0000-0003-4183-2439,56276130100.0,

Considered a transient population, these young professionals may view their positions as stepping-stones along their path to graduate programs in medicine or public health. Objective: To address the needs of these future health professionals, a novel program-Program for Research Assistant Development and Achievement (PRADA)-was developed to facilitate the development of desirable professional skill sets (ie, leadership, teamwork, communication) through participation in peer-driven service and advocacy initiatives directed toward the hospital and surrounding communities. The authors hope that by reporting on the low-cost benefits of the program that other institutions might consider the utility of implementing such a program and recognize the importance of acknowledging the professional needs of the next generation of health care professionals. Methods: In 2011, an anonymous, Web-based satisfaction survey was distributed to the program membership through a pre-established email distribution list. The survey was used to evaluate demographics, level of participation and satisfaction with the various programming, career trajectory, and whether the program's goals were being met. Results: Upon the completion of the survey cycle, a 69.8% (125/179) response rate was achieved with the majority of respondents (94/119, 79.0%) reporting their 3-year goal to be in medical school (52/119, 43.7%) or nonmedical graduate school (42/119, 35.3%). Additionally, most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that PRADA had made them feel more a part of a research community (88/117, 75.2%), enhanced their job satisfaction (66/118, 55.9%), and provided career guidance (63/117, 53.8%). Overall, 85.6% of respondents (101/118) agreed or strongly agreed with recommending PRADA to other research assistants. Conclusions: High response rate and favorable outlook among respondents indicate that the program had been well received by the program's target population. The high percentage of respondents seeking short-term entry into graduate programs in health care-related fields supports the claim that many RAs may see their positions as stepping-stones and therefore could benefit from a professional development program such as the one described herein. Strong institutional support and sustainable growth and participation are other indications of early success. Further evaluation is necessary to assess the full impact of the program, particularly in areas such as job satisfaction, recruitment, retention, productivity, and career trajectory, but also in reproducibility in other institutions.",10.2196/mededu.4576,Boston Children's Hospital,0000-0003-4183-2439,56276130100.0,

Considered a transient population, these young professionals may view their positions as stepping-stones along their path to graduate programs in medicine or public health. Objective: To address the needs of these future health professionals, a novel program-Program for Research Assistant Development and Achievement (PRADA)-was developed to facilitate the development of desirable professional skill sets (ie, leadership, teamwork, communication) through participation in peer-driven service and advocacy initiatives directed toward the hospital and surrounding communities.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Musculoskeletal problems are common in primary care, yet many family physicians lack confidence and competence in this area. The Advanced Primary Care Orthopedics (APCO) course utilizes hands-on physical exam instruction, interactive cases, and intentional repetition to teach anatomy, a standardized exam, and important diagnoses. This study assesses the effectiveness of APCO in improving musculoskeletal exam knowledge and confidence. METHODS: APCO is a 1.5-day course taught annually to family medicine residents. A 1-day course has also been conducted as a preconference workshop targeting faculty physicians. Participants completed pre-and postcourse assessments to evaluate their knowledge and confidence with the musculoskeletal exam. We compared results using mean differences with paired t-test statistics. RESULTS: In the 2018 and 2019 resident courses, 23 of 30 participants (77%) completed the knowledge assessment and 25 of 30 participants (83%) completed the confidence assessment. Knowledge assessment scores improved by 9.5 points (P<.05) after completion of the course. Confidence in the musculoskeletal exam, as assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (1–not confident at all; 5–very confident), improved from 2.2 to 3.8 after the course (P<.05). In the 2018 preconference workshop, 23 of 36 participants (64%) completed the confidence assessment. Confidence increased from 2.17 to 3.61 (P<.05) after course completion. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the APCO course increased short-term musculoskeletal knowledge and confidence. APCO has many potential applications for residency curriculums, faculty development, and continuing medical education.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.362716,Swedish First Hill Family Medicine Residency,0000-0003-4183-2439,56276130100.0,

Elizabeth Kennedy Jones,Creative art and medical student development: a qualitative study,2017.0,Medical Education,Article,Art,"2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education.Objectives: Although many medical schools include arts-based activities in their curricula, empirical evidence is lacking regarding how the creation of art might impact medical students and their professional development. We used a qualitative research design in order to understand this process. Methods: We conducted and analysed interviews with 16 medical students who had created and presented original artwork in the context of a required narrative-based undergraduate medical education programme. Teams of students collaborated to create interpretive projects based on common themes arising from conversations with individuals with chronic illness and their families. Open-ended questions were utilised to explore the conceptualisation and presentation of the projects, the dynamics of teamwork and the meaning(s) they might have for the students' professional development. We identified themes using repeated contextual reading of the transcripts, which also enhanced accuracy of the interpretations and ensured saturation of themes. Results: Several major themes and sub-themes were identified. The creation of art led to a sense of personal growth and development, including reflection on past life experiences, self-discovery and an awareness of art as a creative outlet. Students also reported an enhanced sense of community and the development of skills in collaboration. Lastly, students reflected on the human dimensions of illness and medical care and identified an enhanced awareness of the experience of those with illness. Conclusions: A programme involving the creation of art based on stories of illness encouraged students’ explorations of conceptions of the self, family and society, as well as illness and medical care, while enhancing the development of a collaborative and patient-centred worldview. Creative art can be a novel educational tool to promote a reflective, humanistic medical practice.",10.1111/medu.13140,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9691-5701,55612048900.0,

Two underused evidence-based practices (EBPs) can reduce the risk: de-prescribe unnecessary antiplatelet therapy or initiate a proton pump inhibitor. We describe the development of a multicomponent intervention to increase use of these EBPs in patients treated with warfarin and followed by an anticoagulation monitoring service (AMS), and the design of a pilot pragmatic implementation trial. Methods: A participatory planning group iteratively used Implementation Mapping and the Multiphase Optimization Strategy to develop implementation strategies and plan the trial. Informed by qualitative interviews with patients and clinicians, we drew on several implementation science theories, as well as self-determination theory, to design interventions. For patients, we developed an activation guide to help patients discuss the EBPs with their clinicians. For clinicians, we developed two electronic health record (EHR)-based interventions: (1) clinician notification (CN) consists of a templated message that identifies a patient as high risk, summarizes the EBPs, and links to a guidance statement on appropriate use of antiplatelet therapy. (2) Clinician notification with nurse facilitation (CN+NF) consists of a similar notification message but includes additional measures by nursing staff to support appropriate and timely decision-making: the nurse performs a chart review to identify any history of vascular disease, embeds indication-specific guidance on antiplatelet therapy in the message, and offers to assist with medication order entry and patient education. We will conduct a pilot factorial cluster- and individual-level randomized controlled trial with a primary objective of evaluating feasibility. Twelve clinicians will be randomized to receive either CN or CN+NF for all their patients managed by the AMS while 50 patients will be individually randomized to receive either the activation guide or usual care. We will explore implementation outcomes using patient and clinician interviews along with EHR review. Discussion: This pilot study will prepare us to conduct a larger optimization study to identify the most potent and resource conscious multicomponent implementation strategy to help AMSs increase the use of best practices for upper GI bleeding risk reduction.

Elizabeth Kennedy Jones,Does performance on evidence-based medicine and urgent clinical scenarios assessments deteriorate during the fourth year of medical school? Findings from one institution,2019.0,Academic Medicine,Conference Paper,Ear,"Copyright © 2019 by the Association of American Medical CollegesPurpose The fourth year of medical school (M4) should prepare students for residency yet remains generally unstructured, with ill-defined goals. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether there were performance changes in evidence-based medicine (EBM) and urgent clinical scenarios (UCS) assessments before and after M4 year. Method University of Michigan Medical School graduates who matched into internship at Michigan Medicine completed identical assessments on EBM and UCS at the beginning of M4 year and 13 months later during postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) orientation. Individual scores on these assessments were compared using paired t test analysis. The associations of academic performance, residency specialty classification, and initial performance on knowledge changes were analyzed. Results During academic years 2014 and 2015, 76 students matched into a Michigan Medicine internship; 52 completed identical EBM stations and 53 completed UCS stations. Learners’ performance on the EBM assessment decreased from M4 to PGY1 (mean 93% [SD = 7%] vs. mean 80% [SD = 13%], P < .01), while performance on UCS remained stable (mean 80% [SD = 9%] vs. mean 82% [SD = 8%], P = .22). High M4 performers experienced a greater rate of decline in knowledge level compared with low M4 performers for EBM (−20% vs. −4%, P = .01). Residency specialty and academic performance did not affect performance. Conclusions This study demonstrated degradation of performance in EBM during the fourth year and adds to the growing literature that highlights the need for curricular reform during this year.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000002583,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9691-5701,55612048900.0,

Elizabeth Kennedy Jones,Implementing evidence-based anticoagulant prescribing: User-centered design findings and recommendations,2022.0,Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis,Article,Tin; anticoagulants; clinical; decision support systems; electronic health records; prescriptions; user-centered design,"2022 The Authors. Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH).Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are widely used medications with an unacceptably high rate of prescription errors and are a leading cause of adverse drug events. Clinical decision support, including medication alerts, can be an effective implementation strategy to reduce prescription errors, but quality is often inconsistent. User-centered design (UCD) approaches can improve the effectiveness of alerts. Objectives: To design effective DOAC prescription alerts through UCD and develop a set of generalizable design recommendations. Methods: This study used an iterative UCD process with practicing clinicians. In three rapid iterative design and assessment stages, prototype alert designs were created and refined using a test electronic health record (EHR) environment and simulated patients. We identified key emergent themes across all user observations and interviews. The themes and final designs were used to derive a set of design guidelines. Results: Our UCD sample comprised 13 prescribers, including advanced practice providers, physicians in training, primary care physicians, and cardiologists. The resulting alert designs embody our design recommendations, which include establishing intended indication, clarifying dosing by renal function, tailoring alert language in drug interactions, facilitating trust in alerts, and minimizing interaction overhead. Conclusions: Through a robust UCD process, we have identified key recommendations for implementing medication alerts aimed at improving evidence-based DOAC prescribing. These recommendations may be applicable to the implementation of DOAC alerts in any EHR systems.",10.1002/rth2.12803,Michigan Medicine,0000-0002-9691-5701,55612048900.0,

Our institution implemented a specialty-specific interprofessiona curriculum during Residency Preparation Courses (RPCs) for senior students including didactics, clinical experiences, and a simulated paging curriculum. Our aim was to determine whether this intervention improved perceptions of interprofesiona roles. We distributed anonymous surveys before (pre-survey) and after (post-survey, collected within 2 weeks of course completion) the RPC to 90 students with questions related to interprofessional roles using a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). Three months after the start of residency, we sent follow-up surveys inquiring about the usefulness of RPC components (1 = not at all useful, 5 = extremely useful). Response rates were 84.4% pre-survey, 63.3% post-survey, and 41.1% follow-up survey. Post-surveys indicated improvement in self-reported ability in all domains: understanding one’s contributions to interprofessional teams (3.9 to 4.4, p < .0001), understanding other team members’ contributions (3.9 to 4.4, p < .0001), learning from interprofessional team members (4.2 to 4.6, p = .0002), accounting for interprofessional perspectives (4.2 to 4.6, p < .0001), and co-developing effective care plans (3.9 to 4.4, p < .0001).

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.New residents are often unprepared to respond to medical emergencies. To address this gap, we implemented a simulated cross-cover paging curriculum. All senior medical students enrolled in a required specialty-specific (internal medicine, procedures, emergency medicine [EM], obstetrics and gynecology [OBGYN], family medicine and pediatrics) residency preparation course (RPC) in 2020–2021 participated. Students received 3–6 specialty-specific pages that represented an urgent change in clinical status about a simulated patient. For each page, students first called a standardized registered nurse (SRN) to ask additional questions, then recommended next steps in evaluation and management. The SRNs delivered immediate verbal feedback, delayed written feedback, and graded clinical performance using a weighted rubric. Some items were categorized as ‘must do,’ which represented the most clinically important actions. Trends in clinical performance over time were analyzed using the Jonckheere–Terpstra test. Of the 315 eligible students, 265 (84.1%) consented for their data to be included in the analysis. Clinical performance improved from a median (interquartile range) of 59.4% (46.9%, 75.0%) on case 1 to 80.0% (68.0%, 86.7%) on case 6 (p <.001). The percentage of ‘must do’ items improved significantly, from 69.2% (53.8, 81.8%) to 80.0% (66.7%, 88,9%) (p <.001). Scores improved over time for all specialty courses except for EM and OB/GYN. Surveyed students largely found this to be a valuable addition to the RPC curriculum with a 4.4 overall rating (1 = poor to 5 = excellent). This novel curriculum fills important gaps in the educational transition between medical school and residency. The simulated paging platform is adaptable and generalizable to learners entering different residency specialties.",10.1080/10872981.2024.2430576,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9691-5701,55612048900.0,

However, there is a lack of rigorous research on academic coaching programs in medical education and recommended coaching practices are based on expert opinion without incorporating the student perspective. The aim of this study was to investigate factors that affect a students’ perception of a successful coaching experience. Materials and method: This was a qualitative study performed in November 2018 at a medical school in the United States with a formal coaching program. Appreciative inquiry was the theoretical framework used to develop the question guide. The authors facilitated two focus groups and then used Colaizzi’s phenomenological analysis approach to analyze the transcripts. Results: A total of 21 students participated in the focus groups. The analysis revealed four themes that describe students’ perceptions of successful coaching experiences: coach attributes, relational skills, coaching skills, and utilization of coaching. Each of these themes had specific dimensions. Conclusions: The findings from this study illuminate the student stakeholder perspectives on successful coaching relationships, and should be considered when developing a coaching program and faculty development.",10.1080/0142159X.2019.1670341,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,3929146.0

Such approaches can require significant investment dependent on the development model used. There is little in the literature on the formative assessment of design and development. Better understanding is needed to determine effective methods of training and supporting faculty authors. Methods: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Web-based modules developed by a Department of Family Medicine in delivering instruction to resident learners and to examine perceptions of the design and development process. Participants included 49 resident learners and 28 faculty and staff members as the development team. Data collection involved use of Web-based surveys, participant observation focus groups, and pretesting/posttesting. Frequency distributions and mean comparisons were used to analyze quantitative data. Participant comments were thematically analyzed. Results: Residents felt that modules met their educational goals and contributed to understanding of core content. Pretest/posttest data showed statistical improvement for a majority of modules. The use of Web authoring software for Web-based learning and scheduling time to work on the modules posed the greatest challenges to module authors. Conclusions: Formative assessment methods can provide important information to module developers and support staff to shape training, content development, and improve module ease of use, navigation, and content for resident learners.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background: Current efforts incompletely address the educational, social, and developmental aspects of a learner’s transition from medical school to residency. Objective: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a transition to residency (TTR) coaching program. Designs: In March 2019, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a TTR coaching program for students who matched into residency programs at our institution. Goals were to stimulate reflection on successes and challenges encountered during medical school, develop strategies to problem-solve barriers and address concerns, identify professional and personal resources, improve confidence, and make an action plan. Results: Of eligible learners, 42% (10/24) enrolled in TTR coaching. Learners were most interested in coaching in the following areas: wellbeing (70%, 7/10), interpersonal/communication skills (60%, 6/10), and learning plan development (50%, 5/10). The majority (90%; 9/10) expressed satisfaction with the program and would recommend participation. One month after starting internship, 90% (9/10) of learners stated the program helped facilitate their transition. Learners who did not enroll in TTR cited concerns around the coach selection process (72%, 8/11), upcoming travel (45%, 5/11), insufficient time/competing demands (27%, 3/11), and lack of perceived benefit (18%, 2/11).

A complete history should address any concerns from the patient and family and screen for lifestyle habits, including diet, physical activity, daily screen time (e.g., television, computer, video games), hours of sleep per night, dental care, and safety habits. School performance can be used for developmental surveillance. A full physical examination should be performed; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine scoliosis screening and testicular examination. Children should be screened for obesity, which is defined as a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, and resources for comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions should be provided to children with obesity. Although the evidence is mixed regarding screening for hypertension before 18 years of age, many experts recommend checking blood pressure annually beginning at three years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vision and hearing screening annually or every two years in school-aged children. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for dyslipidemia in children of any age, or screening for depression before 12 years of age. All children should receive at least 400 IU of vitamin D daily, with higher doses indicated in children with vitamin D deficiency. Children who live in areas with inadequate fluoride in the water (less than 0.6 ppm) should receive a daily fluoride supplement. Age-appropriate immunizations should be given, as well as any missed immunizations. © 2011 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

Children and families should be advised to eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy products, beans, fish, and lean meats, while limiting sugar, fast food, and highly processed foods. Children should engage in at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity, and screen time (e.g., television, computer, video games) should be limited to no more than one to two hours of quality programming daily. Most school-aged children require 11 hours of sleep per night. Decreased sleep is associated with behavioral issues, decreased concentration at school, and obesity. Children should brush their teeth twice per day with a toothpaste containing fluoride. Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death in this age group in the United States, and families should be counseled on traffic, water, sports, and firearm safety. Because high-risk behaviors may start in early adolescence, many experts recommend screening for tobacco, alcohol, and drug use beginning at 11 years of age. Sexually active adolescents should be counseled on protecting against sexually transmitted infections, and should be screened for these infections if indicated. © 2011 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

Purpose: This study described the development, implementation, and evaluation of an IT approach to improve preceptors' skills for increasing patients' acceptance of medical student participation in clinical care. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with faculty, residents, medical students, and clinic staff to discuss issues related to patients declining medical student participation. Findings were used to develop a faculty development session using an IT approach. At a Family Medicine grand rounds presentation, faculty and resident preceptors (n = 42) participated in the IT workshop and completed a pre-post survey assessing skills specific to increasing students' training opportunities in patient care and educational impact of the session. Results: Following the IT session, preceptors reported greater self-efficacy for helping patients feel more comfortable with medical students in the exam room (p =.031, d = 0.338) and increased comfort level with talking to patients about medical students performing sensitive exams (p=.010,d=0.357).Eighty-eight percent of preceptors agreed or strongly agreed that the session was relevant to improving clinical precepting skills and helped them develop strategies for enhancing medical student involvement in care. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the interactive theatre approach to faculty development is an innovative and effective method to increase preceptors' comfort with discussing medical student involvement with patients.

With an understanding of the coding guidelines, physicians have the opportunity to clearly document and be reimbursed for the complex medical services that they provide. It is important that physicians avoid the common pitfalls of undercoding outpatient visits, not reporting separately identifiable services (modifier 25), and not taking credit for the time spent counseling patients.

All Rights Reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lack of quality mentorship has been identified as an impediment to a successful academic career. This study serves as a needs assessment to understand baseline mentoring among faculty in an academic department of family medicine and the existing relationships between mentorship, job satisfaction, and academic productivity before the department begins a structured mentorship program. METHODS: All faculty received an anonymous online survey inquiring about their current mentorship and their perception of the importance of mentorship, in addition to measures of job satisfaction and academic productivity. RESULTS: Of 62 faculty members completing the survey (83% of faculty), almost all indicated it is very or somewhat important to have a mentor (97%, n=60), although only 45% (n=28) reported having a current mentor. Junior faculty were less likely than senior faculty to be satisfied with their mentorship, particularly if they did not have a current mentor. Job satisfaction was high and was not associated with having a mentor. Faculty members with mentors were more likely to have presented a talk or poster nationally, to have taken on a new educational or leadership role, and to have had a greater volume of academic activities overall. CONCLUSIONS: Although faculty believe mentorship is important, less than half have a current mentor. Junior faculty are disproportionately dissatisfied by lack of mentorship. Mentorship was associated with some elements of academic productivity but not with job satisfaction.

Residencies ask RPS to assist in preparing for accreditation site visits by the Residency Review Committee-Family Medicine (RC-FM). The RPS Criteria for Excellence in Family Medicine Education (RPS Criteria) may have influenced the accreditation standards of the RC-FM. RPS consultations also may affect accreditation visit cycle length and number of RC-FM citations. Methods: The authors reviewed the RC-FM Program Requirements for Family Medicine Residency Education and the RPS Criteria from 1978 to 2007, comparing statements between the two documents for ""nearly verbatim"" and equivalent ""must"" or ""should"" requirements. The average number of citations and cycle length for programs seeking a Comprehensive Accreditation Program (CAP) Consultation from 2004-2010 were compared to cohort programs evaluated at the same RC-FM meeting using an independent samples t test. Results: The strongest relationship between the RC-FM requirements and the RPS criteria occurred in 1983-1984. Nine ""nearly verbatim"" statements, 15 ""must-should"" or ""must-must"" statements, and 11 ""should-should"" statements existed. Over time, additional concurrences between organizational statements occurred. Residency programs with CAP consultations benefited significantly by both a decrease in number of citations and an increase in the length of accreditation cycle. Conclusions: The RPS Criteria have positively impacted iterations of RC-FM requirements. Family medicine residency programs concerned about successful accreditation by the RC-FM will likely benefit from RPS CAP consultations by increased length of accreditation cycle and/or a decreased number of citations.",,American Academy of Family Physicians,,6507891043.0,

All rights reserved.Problem Transforming medical school curricula to train physicians to better address society's needs is a complex task, as students must develop expertise in areas other than clinical medicine. Approach In 2010, the University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS) launched the Global Health and Disparities (GHD) Path of Excellence as part of a larger curriculum transformation. The GHD Path is a co-curriculum with the goal of ameliorating health disparities in the United States and abroad. It was developed iteratively based on student and faculty feedback. Student feedback emphasized the value of the relationships with faculty and other students, the capstone project, and exposure to role models and professional networks. Faculty described the joy of interacting with students and the desire for recognition by their departments for their role as an advisor. Outcomes Informed by the GHD Path experience, UMMS embraced the Path model, which emphasized professional relationships, career development, and high-impact scholarly work, making it different from the traditional medical curriculum, and the school implemented 7 other Paths between 2013 and 2018. Elements common to all Paths include a capstone project, a longitudinal advisor separate from the capstone advisor, exposure to role models and leaders, and the dissemination of scholarly work to promote networking. Next Steps Next steps for the Paths of Excellence include developing methods to systematically monitor students' progress, facilitating mentoring skills in and recognizing faculty advisors, and measuring the long-term impact of the Paths on students and society.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000002783,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

However, systematic, data-driven program development methods have not been described. Method The authors examined scholarly concentration programs at U.S. medical schools that U.S. News & World Report ranked as top 25 for research or primary care (n = 43 institutions), coding concentrations and mission statements. Subsequently, the authors conducted a targeted needs assessment via a studentled, institution-wide survey, eliciting learners' preferences for 10 ""Pathways"" (i.e., concentrations) and 30 ""Topics"" (i.e., potential content) augmenting core curricula at their institution. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a capacity optimization algorithm characterized best institutional options for learnerfocused Pathway development. Results The authors identifed scholarly concentration programs at 32 of 43 medical schools (74%), comprising 199 distinct concentrations (mean concentrations per program: 6.2, mode: 5, range: 1-16). Thematic analysis identifed 10 content domains; most common were ""Global/Public Health"" (30 institutions; 94%) and ""Clinical/ Translational Research"" (26 institutions; 81%). The institutional needs assessment (n = 468 medical students; response rate 60% overall, 97% among frst-year students) demonstrated myriad student preferences for Pathways and Topics. EFA of Topic preferences identifed eight factors, systematically related to Pathway preferences, informing content development. Capacity modeling indicated that offering six Pathways could guarantee 95% of frst-year students (162/171) their frst- or second-choice Pathway. Conclusions This study demonstrates a generalizable, data-driven approach to scholarly concentration program development that reffects student preferences and institutional strengths, while optimizing program diversity within capacity constraints.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000001362,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,
Eric Paul Skye,The cultural context of teaching and learning sexual health care examinations in Japan: A mixed methods case study assessing the use of standardized patient instructors among Japanese family physician trainees of the Shizuoka Family Medicine Program,2015.0,Asia Pacific Family Medicine,Article,Family medicine; Japan; Sexual health; Standardized patient instructors; Family medicine; Japan; Sexual health; Standardized patient instructors,"2015 Shultz et al.Background: In contrast to many western nations where family medicine is a cornerstone of the primary care workforce, in Japan the specialty is still developing. A number of services within the bailiwick of family medicine have yet to be fully incorporated into Japanese family medicine training programs, especially those associated with sexual health. This gap constitutes a lost opportunity for addressing sexual health-related conditions, including cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this mixed methods case study we investigated the perceived acceptability and impact of a standardized patient instructor (SPI) program that trained Japanese family medicine residents in female breast, pelvic, male genital, and prostate examinations. Case description: Building on an existing partnership between the University of Michigan, USA, and the Shizuoka Family Medicine Program, Japan, Japanese family medicine residents received SPI-based training in female breast, pelvic, male genital, and prostate examinations at the University of Michigan. A mixed methods case study targeting residents, trainers, and staff was employed using post-training feedback, semi-structured interviews, and web-based questionnaire. Discussion and evaluation: Residents' and SPIs' perceptions of the training were universally positive, with SPIs observing a positive effect on residents' knowledge, confidence, and skill. SPIs found specific instruction-related approaches to be particularly helpful, such as the positioning of the interpreter and the timing of interpreter use. SPIs provided an important opportunity for residents to learn about the patient's perspective and to practice newly learned skills. Respondents noted a general preference for gender concordance when providing gender-specific health care; also noted were too few opportunities to practice skills after returning to Japan. For cultural reasons, both residents and staff deemed it would be difficult to implement a similar SPI-based program within Japan. Conclusions: While the SPI program was perceived favorably, without sufficient practice and supervision the skills acquired by residents during the training may not be fully retained. Deep-rooted taboos surrounding gender-specific health care appear to be a significant barrier preventing experimentation with SPI-based sexual health training in Japan. The feasibility of implementing a similar training program within Japan remains uncertain. More research is needed to understand challenges and how they can be overcome.",10.1186/s12930-015-0025-4,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

This study investigated the use of interactive theater and role play with professional actors in teaching breaking bad news to medical students. The objectives were to explore the contexts, approaches, experiences, and reactions in giving and receiving bad news. Second-year medical students participated in a required educational session that utilized interactive theater which helps students learn about the issues of breaking bad news to a patient with cancer. Following the interactive theater piece, professional actors provided students role play experiences in small groups with breaking bad news. Anonymous evaluation surveys were given out to all second-year medical students at the conclusion of the breaking bad news session. Surveys contained quantitative and qualitative responses. Three years of evaluations were analyzed. A total of 451 (88 %) students completed the evaluations. Comments were thematically analyzed. Ninety-four percent agreed that the theater piece prompted reflection on patient-provider communications, and 89 % agreed that it stimulated discussion on complex issues with breaking bad news. The two most common themes in student comments concerned the importance of realism in the theater piece, and the value of experiencing multiple perspectives. Use of professional actors during the role play exercises enhances the realism and pushed the students out of their own “comfort zones” in ways that may more closely approximate real life clinical situations. Interactive theater can be a potentially powerful tool to teach breaking bad news during medical school.",10.1007/s13187-014-0641-y,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

Forty-eight percent and 62% of preceptors have ""sometimes"" or ""often"" had patients decline student involvement due to student's status and in the context of a gynecological/urological exam, respectively. Fifty-eight percent ""never"" or ""seldom"" obtain patient consent with the student outside the exam room, while 46% ""often"" or ""always"" have the student directly inform patients about his/her involvement. Being a faculty preceptor (versus resident preceptor) (r = 0.463, p = 0.026) and feeling uncomfortable talking to patients about students performing the exam (r = -0.482, p = 0.020) were associated with patients declining student participation for a genital exam. Findings indicate that preceptors encounter patients declining medical student involvement in general and sensitive exam scenarios. In addition, patients are more likely to decline student participation when preceptors are faculty members and less comfortable discussing student involvement. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",10.1007/s10459-008-9145-z,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

Eric Paul Skye,Use of Interactive Theater and Role Play to Develop Medical Students’ Skills in Breaking Bad News,2014.0,Journal of Cancer Education,Article,Communication skills; Death and dying; Ethics/attitudes; Instructional design; Interactive theater; Small group learning,"2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Creative arts have been increasingly implemented in medical education. This study investigated the use of interactive theater and role play with professional actors in teaching breaking bad news to medical students. The objectives were to explore the contexts, approaches, experiences, and reactions in giving and receiving bad news. Second-year medical students participated in a required educational session that utilized interactive theater which helps students learn about the issues of breaking bad news to a patient with cancer. Following the interactive theater piece, professional actors provided students role play experiences in small groups with breaking bad news. Anonymous evaluation surveys were given out to all second-year medical students at the conclusion of the breaking bad news session. Surveys contained quantitative and qualitative responses. Three years of evaluations were analyzed. A total of 451 (88 %) students completed the evaluations. Comments were thematically analyzed. Ninety-four percent agreed that the theater piece prompted reflection on patient-provider communications, and 89 % agreed that it stimulated discussion on complex issues with breaking bad news. The two most common themes in student comments concerned the importance of realism in the theater piece, and the value of experiencing multiple perspectives. Use of professional actors during the role play exercises enhances the realism and pushed the students out of their own “comfort zones” in ways that may more closely approximate real life clinical situations. Interactive theater can be a potentially powerful tool to teach breaking bad news during medical school.",10.1007/s13187-014-0641-y,University of Michigan Medical School,,6507891043.0,

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to address patient questions regarding metal detectors, as well as deep venous thrombosis risk with flying. Further, patient questions pertaining to specific airlines, airports, and Transportation Security Administration policies were answered through direct discussion with representatives, website review, and internet research. Ultimately, providers should be aware of the many challenges that orthopedic patients face during air travel, and patients should consult their providers before making travel plans. Airline passengers are likewise encouraged to equip themselves with the information presented in this article, to best advocate for themselves.

Latissimus dorsi detrusor myoplasty (LDDM) has been shown to provide functional contraction and allow patients with bladder acontractility to void voluntarily. Our goal was to summarize experimental studies of LDDM. We hypothesized that experimental studies would show that latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) flaps for detrusor myoplasty have superior outcomes when compared with other types of flaps. On January 17, 2020, we conducted a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Answers, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE databases, without time frame limitations, to identify articles on the use of LDDM. We excluded studies that investigated other treatments. Of 54 articles identified by the search, three fulfilled the eligibility criteria.

Latissimus dorsi detrusor myoplasty (LDDM) is a therapeutic option that allows patients with bladder acontractility to void voluntarily. Our goal was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to determine whether LDDM is a better option than clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) (standard treatment) in patients with bladder acontractility. On January 17, 2020, we conducted a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Answers, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, without time frame limitations, to identify articles on the use of LDDM for bladder acontractility. Of 75 potential articles, 4 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The use of LDDM to treat patients with bladder acontractility was reported in four case series by the same group in Europe. Fifty-eight patients were included, and no comparison groups were included. The most common cause of bladder acontractility was spinal cord injury (n =36). The mean ( ±standard deviation) operative time was 536 ( ±22) minutes, postoperative length of hospital stay ranged from 10 to 13 days, and follow-up ranged from 9 to 68 months. Most patients had complete response, were able to void voluntarily, and had post-void residual volume less than 100 mL.

We examined expression of Zfhep in the rat forebrain during embryonic and postnatal development. Zfhep mRNA was strongly expressed in the progenitor cells of the ventricular zone around the lateral ventricles on E14 and E16, but showed little expression in cells that had migrated to form the developing cortex. Dual labeling with PCNA demonstrated expression of Zfhep mRNA in proliferating cells. Expression of Zfhep in the ventricular zone decreases during late development as the population of progenitor cells decreases. This pattern is distinctly different from other members of the Zfh family. We also examined the expression of Zfhep protein during retinoic acid-induced neurogenesis of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Zfhep is highly expressed in P19 neuroblasts, and expression decreases by the time of morphological neurogenesis. Hence, both P19 cells and embryonic brain demonstrate a loss of Zfhep expression during the transition from proliferating precursor to differentiated neural cells. We investigated a possible link between Zfhep and proliferation by treating human glial cell lines with Zfhep antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Two Zfhep antisense oligonucleotides repressed proliferation of either U-138 or U-343 glioblastoma cells more than control oligonucleotides. Based on the expression patterns of Zfhep in vivo and in the P19 cell model of neurogenesis, we suggest that Zfhep may play a role in proliferation or differentiation of neural cells. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Universal screening for GBS among women at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation is more effective than administration of intrapartum antibiotics based on risk factors. Lower vaginal and rectal cultures for GBS are collected at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation, and routine clindamycin and erythromycin susceptibility testing is performed in women allergic to penicillin. Women with GBS bacteriuria in the current pregnancy and those who previously delivered a GBS-septic newborn are not screened but automatically receive intrapartum antibiotics. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is selected based on maternal allergy history and susceptibility of GBS isolates. Intravenous penicillin G is the preferred antibiotic, with ampicillin as an alternative. Penicillin G should be administered at least four hours before delivery for maximum effectiveness. Cefazolin is recommended in women allergic to penicillin who are at low risk of anaphylaxis. Clindamycin and erythromycin are options for women at high risk for anaphylaxis, and vancomycin should be used in women allergic to penicillin and whose cultures indicate resistance to clindamycin and erythromycin or when susceptibility is unknown. Asymptomatic neonates born to GBS-colonized mothers should be observed for at least 24 hours for signs of sepsis. Newborns who appear septic should have diagnostic work-up including blood culture followed by initiation of ampicillin and gentamicin. Studies indicate that intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS carriers and selective administration of antibiotics to newborns reduce neonatal GBS sepsis by as much as 80 to 95 percent.

The language and cultural interpretations can be barriers to healthcare access. Despite the need for a robust translation process, the existing literature offers little information about best practices for translation. Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative research was to illustrate a systematic approach to developing an accurate translation. We describe the process of developing an accurate and culturally relevant translation of the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) from English to Arabic. The CD-RISC is a healthcare instrument to measure resilience and comprises 25 items rated on a 5-point scale, with higher scores reflecting increased resilience. Resilience is an important healthcare construct that can be applied to research on mental illness and adaptation ability. For instance, increased resilience appears to protect against diminished mental health. The translation process began as two individuals independently translated the CD-RISC into Arabic. A third person combined the two translations to produce a reconciled version. A fourth individual then back-translated the reconciled Arabic version to English. To resolve difficult-to-translate segments, the research team consulted with the instrument developer and then conducted cognitive testing with six individuals. A cultural research methodologist participated throughout the process. Among the 28 text segments in the CD-RISC (the title, instructions, scoring, and 25 items), the best equivalency in Arabic came from eight segments of each forward-translation. The remaining 12 segments were similar. Each the back-translation and cognitive testing contributed to seven revisions.

Treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is considered first-line therapy for persistent asthma. Objective: We sought to determine the degree to which African American patients respond to ICS medication and whether the level of response is influenced by other factors, including genetic ancestry. Methods: Patients aged 12 to 56 years who received care from a large health system in southeast Michigan and who resided in Detroit were recruited to participate if they had a diagnosis of asthma. Patients were treated with 6 weeks of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate, and pulmonary function was remeasured after treatment. Ancestry was determined by genotyping ancestry-informative markers. The main outcome measure was ICS responsiveness defined as the change in prebronchodilator FEV1 over the 6-week course of treatment. Results: Among 147 participating African American patients with asthma, average improvement in FEV1 after 6 weeks of ICS treatment was 11.6%. The mean proportion of African ancestry in this group was 78.4%. The degree of baseline bronchodilator reversibility was the only factor consistently associated with ICS responsiveness, as measured by both an improvement in FEV1 and patient-reported asthma control (P = .001 and P = .021, respectively). The proportion of African ancestry was not significantly associated with ICS responsiveness. Conclusions: Although baseline pulmonary function parameters appear to be associated with the likelihood to respond to ICS treatment, the proportion of genetic African ancestry does not. This study suggests that genetic ancestry might not contribute to differences in ICS controller response among African American patients with asthma. © 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",10.1016/j.jaci.2010.08.002,Henry Ford Health System,0000-0001-6836-7587,35072151300.0,

Setting The family medicine postgraduate trainees and the most recent graduates in the three training sites, Accra, Kumasi and Mampong, as well as modular residents in Ghana served as the targeted participants during data collection between October and November of 2018. Participants Second and third year family medicine residents, fellows (known as senior residents in Ghana) and recent graduates were invited to participate in this study. Thirty-five of 77 eligible subjects provided responses (46% response rate), but five records were eliminated due to incomplete data to yield a survey completion rate of 39% (30/77).

Toma,Patient Satisfaction as a Function of Emergency Department Previsit Expectations,2009.0,Annals of Emergency Medicine,Article,Art,"Study objectives: This study measures the effect of meeting emergency department (ED) patients' expectations for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on patient satisfaction. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients during block enrollment periods surveyed at the beginning and end of their ED visits. On arrival patients or their surrogates were surveyed about the specific interventions they expected during their visit. After completion of ED care, they were surveyed about their level of satisfaction with the entire encounter, assessment of their provider's interpersonal skills, impression of time spent waiting in the ED, and perceived waiting time. Satisfaction was assessed with categorical responses. The degree of concordance of interventions expected and interventions provided was analyzed to determine their effect on overall ED visit satisfaction. Results: Nine hundred eighty-seven patients presented during enrollment periods, 821 met inclusion criteria, and complete data were collected on 504 patient encounters. Twenty-nine percent had no previsit expectations of diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, 24% had a single reported expectation, 47% had multiple intervention expectations. After adjusting for potential confounders, we could not demonstrate a relationship between fulfillment of expectations and satisfaction. We did find a very strong relationship between highly ranked provider interpersonal skills and ED satisfaction (probability ratio of being ""very satisfied"" 8.6; 95% confidence interval 4.7 to 15.6). Other factors associated with high ED encounter satisfaction were adequate explanations for waiting times and perception of total time in the ED. Conclusion: Overall satisfaction was strongly correlated with patient's assessment of the physician's interpersonal skills and was not correlated with whether the physician had met expectations about diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. © 2009 American College of Emergency Physicians.",10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.01.024,State University of New York Albany,0000-0001-6836-7587,35072151300.0,

However, no studies have been conducted specifically to examine naltrexone for this purpose or to test whether naltrexone has benefit when added to smoking cessation counseling that explicitly addresses heavy drinking. Methods: We recruited heavy-drinking smokers from the community and randomized them to receive 10 weeks of either (i) 50 mg naltrexone (n = 75) or (ii) placebo (n = 75) daily. Participants received 6 weeks of transdermal nicotine patch and 6 sessions of counseling that addressed both heavy drinking and smoking. Participants were followed for 26 weeks after their target quit smoking date. Results: Across medication conditions, there were substantial reductions at follow-up in percent heavy drinking days (primary outcome) and average drinks per week (secondary outcome). However, participants receiving naltrexone did not differ significantly from those receiving placebo on percent heavy drinking days (effect size d = −0.04, 95% CI [−0.30, 0.22], p = 0.76) or average drinks per week (d = −0.09, 95% CI [−0.35, 0.18], p = 0.54) during follow-up. Naltrexone compared to placebo was not associated with a significant increase in smoking abstinence rates during follow-up, odds ratio = 0.93, 95% CI [0.46, 1.86], p = 0.83. The effect of naltrexone on these outcomes was not significantly moderated by current alcohol dependence or gender. Conclusions: Results indicate that heavy-drinking smokers, including those with current alcohol dependence, can make substantial reductions in drinking in the context of smoking cessation treatment. However, this study provided no evidence that naltrexone is efficacious for enhancing reductions in drinking or improving smoking cessation in this population. Limitations of this study included lower-than-desired sample size and modest adherence to study medication.",10.1111/acer.13396,Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures: We conducted a 9-month, longitudinal randomized controlled trial with a multisite recruitment strategy including clinic, university, and social referrals, and compared the CAMI with didactic educational counseling in 572 female adolescents with a mean age of 17 years (SD = 2.2 years; range = 13-21 years; 59% African American) who were at risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The primary outcome was the acceptability of the CAMI according to self-reported rating scales. The secondary outcome was the reduction of pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease risk using a 9-month, self-report timeline follow-back calendar of unprotected sex. Results: The CAMI was rated easy to use. Compared with the didactic educational counseling, there was a significant effect of the intervention which suggested that the CAMI helped reduce unprotected sex among participants who completed the study. However, because of the high attrition rate, the intent to treat analysis did not demonstrate a significant effect of the CAMI on reducing the rate of unprotected sex. Conclusion: Among those who completed the intervention, the CAMI reduced unprotected sex among an at-risk, predominantly minority sample of female adolescents. Modification of the CAMI to address methodological issues that contributed to a high drop-out rate are needed to make the intervention more acceptable and feasible for use among sexually active predominantly minority, at-risk, female adolescents.",10.1016/j.jpag.2015.06.001,Mailman School of Public Health,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Traditional means of substance use treatment may not meet the needs of this vulnerable population. Mobile interventions, however, have demonstrated high acceptability and efficacy across a range of mental and physical health issues. The specific advantages to mobile interventions dovetail well with the barriers faced by youth exiting foster care. This study describes the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of iHeLP, a computer- and mobile phone-based intervention based in Motivational Interviewing for reducing substance use among youth exiting foster care (n = 33). Participants were randomly assigned to either iHeLP or a contact control, each of which lasted six months. Feasibility was evaluated through eligibility and enrollment rates at baseline, and retention and intervention reach rates 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Acceptability was measured through a 5-item satisfaction measure and exit interviews. The two groups were then compared on a monthly measure of substance use. Study enrollment, retention, response rate, engagement, and satisfaction were all very good. Participants receiving iHeLP reported higher percent days abstinent than the control group, with effect sizes ranging from 0.32 to 0.62.

Maternal mental health concerns, including depression and anxiety, are prevalent during the perinatal period particularly among women experiencing IPV. Screening and interventions for IPV targeting women seeking mental health treatment are lacking. In the current study, we examine the feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary efficacy of a brief, motivational computer-based intervention, SURE (Strength for U in Relationship Empowerment), for perinatal women with IPV seeking mental health treatment. The study design was a two-group, randomized controlled trial with 53 currently pregnant or within 6-months postpartum women seeking mental health treatment at a large urban hospital-based behavioral health clinic for perinatal women. Findings support the acceptability and feasibility of the SURE across a number of domains including content, delivery, and retention. All participants (100%) found the information and resources in SURE to be helpful. Our preliminary results found the degree of IPV decreased significantly from baseline to the 4-month follow-up for the SURE condition (paired t-test, p < 0.001), while the control group was essentially unchanged. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in emotional abuse for SURE participants (p = 0.023) relative to participants in the control condition. There were also reductions in physical abuse although non-significant (p = 0.060). Future work will test SURE in a larger, more diverse sample.

Also, despite the possibility of underreporting or relapse, many at-risk women report that they quit drinking after pregnancy confirmation so that interventions focusing on current drinking may seem unnecessary. The Computerized Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use in Pregnancy (C-BIAP) was designed to (a) be implemented via a handheld device in prenatal clinics, and (b) use a modified brief intervention strategy with women who screen at-risk but report no current drinking. Methods: The authors administered the C-BIAP to 18 T-ACE (Tolerance, Annoyance, Cut Down, and Eye Opener)-positive pregnant African American women who provided quantitative and qualitative feedback.

Given the critical window for treatment during the perinatal period, more information is needed about the characteristics of women who abuse marijuana and about their unique needs with the goal of improving clinical services and outcomes for both women and their infants. Objectives: To (1) identify a profile of perinatal women seeking treatment for primarily marijuana abuse and (2) report birth outcomes in a subset of pregnant women with marijuana abuse. Methods: This retrospective clinical chart review study examined 67 adult perinatal women patients (54 % ethnic minority) who attended an inner-city, hospital-affiliated outpatient program specializing in substance abuse treatment for women. Of all pregnant women, 26 % reported positive urine screens during the first trimester, 41 % during the second trimester, and 27 % during the third trimester. While the subset of pregnant women was small, exploratory results suggest that infants whose mothers continued to use marijuana during their pregnancies were born at a lower gestational age than mothers who abstained; t(29) = 2.04, p <0.05.

Technology-delivered approaches are a promising alternative, particularly during pregnancy when the importance of alcohol use is amplified. The present trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an interactive, empathic, video-enhanced, and computer-delivered SBI (e-SBI) plus 3 tailored mailings, and estimated intervention effects. Methods: We recruited 48 pregnant women who screened positive for alcohol risk at an urban prenatal care clinic. Participants were randomly assigned to the e-SBI plus mailings or to a control session on infant nutrition, and were re-evaluated during their postpartum hospitalization. The primary outcome was 90-day period prevalence abstinence as measured by timeline follow-back interview. Results: Participants rated the intervention as easy to use and helpful (4.7 to 5.0 on a 5-point scale). Blinded follow-up evaluation at childbirth revealed medium-size intervention effects on 90-day period prevalence abstinence (OR=3.4); similarly, intervention effects on a combined healthy pregnancy outcome variable (live birth, normal birthweight, and no neonatal intensive care unit stay) were also of moderate magnitude in favor of e-SBI participants (OR=3.3). As expected in this intentionally underpowered pilot trial, these effects were nonsignificant (p=0.19 and 0.09, respectively). Conclusions: This pilot trial demonstrated the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of e-SBI plus tailored mailings for alcohol use in pregnancy. These findings mirror the promising results of other trials using a similar approach and should be confirmed in a fully powered trial.",10.1111/acer.12747,Wayne State University School of Medicine,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Research suggests that 21% to 33% of perinatal women report IPV and there is an enormous amount of morbidity associated with IPV. Moreover, IPV places women at high risk for several psychiatric disorders, which transforms the perinatal period from an already challenging process into a potentially overwhelming one. Further, IPV and untreated mental illness during the perinatal period pose a dual risk of adverse physical and emotional outcomes for women and their developing fetus/infant. Given the high rates of IPV among women who seek mental health treatment, mental health clinics compared to other medical settings are more effective sites for focused case finding and intervention. Our team has successfully tested an innovative, computerized intervention, Strength for U in Relationship Empowerment (SURE). SURE is a brief, interactive program consistent with motivational interviewing and incorporates empowerment strategies. The proposed multisite randomized clinical trial (N = 186) will test whether SURE relative to control is associated with reduced IPV, greater positive affect and well-being, and greater perceived emotional support. We will also evaluate the role of theoretical mediators of empowerment and self-efficacy. Finally, we will estimate the resources needed and costs to deliver SURE, as well as the incremental cost effectiveness of SURE compared with treatment as usual. If SURE is found to be efficacious and cost effective, it can be easily integrated into clinical care and will fill a critical gap for a vulnerable, high-risk population.",10.1016/j.cct.2020.106011,The University of Akron,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Inviting at-risk youth to participate in the creation of intervention material can augment acceptability for their peers. Methods: To improve intervention messaging, this study examines the utility of a card sort technique when creating cellular phone text messages to be used in a preventive substance-use intervention. During focus groups with 24 youths who are exiting the foster care system—a population with distinct cultural attributes—participants were asked to rate stage of change-specific health messages rooted in Motivational Interviewing and the Transtheoretical Model. Results: Participants unanimously favored content that encouraged autonomy and choice. Statements that invited a “look to the future” were also rated favorably. Messages that referenced the past were not rated well, as were suggestions for professional assistance. Finally, encouragement to receive social support for change was met with ambivalence. While some participants regarded support as helpful, many others felt a severe lack of support in their lives, possibly prompting further substance use. Conclusions: Youth exiting foster care constitutes a unique population whose voice is paramount in the development of interventions. The content present in traditional approaches to substance-use prevention (e.g., increasing social support) may not apply to this group of vulnerable youth. The card sort technique has strong potential to evoke youth-specific intervention content that is more readily understood and accepted by target audiences. Intervention content written by adults for youth can result in miscommunication due to generational and cultural differences. Co-creation, rather, can augment acceptability. We examined the utility of a card sort technique when creating text messages for a preventive substance use intervention. Twenty-four youth exiting foster care rated messages rooted in Motivational Interviewing and the Transtheoretical Model. Participants favored content that encouraged autonomy or “looking forward.” Messages about the past and suggestions for professional assistance were rated poorly. Encouragement to rely on social support was met with ambivalence, as some felt discouraged that they lacked supports. The voice of foster youth is paramount for intervention development.

Mobile interventions have shown efficacy for several mental and physical health issues and may be helpful in overcoming barriers facing foster youth with substance use problems. A program (iHeLP) for substance use reduction was developed that used a computerized screening and brief intervention (SBI) followed by six months of dynamically-tailored text messages. The program was shown to focus groups of youth (N = 24) ages 18–19 who recently left foster care and had moderate to severe substance use risk. Focus group feedback was used to modify iHeLP prior to delivery in an open trial (N = 16). Both study phases included assessments of feasibility and acceptability; the open trial also included assessments of substance use outcomes at 3 and 6 months. Focus groups indicated a high level of acceptability for the proposed intervention components. Of those screened for the open trial, 43% were eligible and 74% of those eligible enrolled, indicating good feasibility. Retention through the final follow-up was 59%, and drop out was associated with involvement in the criminal justice system. Participant ratings for liking, ease of working with, interest in and respectfulness of the SBI were high. Satisfaction ratings for the texting component were also high.

At the same time, the majority of those who recover from an alcohol-use disorder do not do so via formal treatment, and brief interventions (one or two sessions, often as brief as 15 min in length) for alcohol use frequently show results that appear equivalent to those of longer interventions, sometimes even with heavier drinkers. Growing evidence suggests that even pretreatment assessment, and/or the decision to seek help and be involved in a research study, can result in significant change. Thus, alternative approaches could be important options for those whose unhealthy drinking is not severe enough to merit formal treatment, as well as with dependent drinkers who are currently unwilling to consider formal treatment. Self-help approaches broadly defined here as any nonpharmaceutical source of assistance not involving a live counselor or other professional may meet the need for an alternative approach that is efficacious, relatively palatable to patients exhibiting unhealthy alcohol use, and minimally burdensome to medical staff. The current review included only interventions that have been subjected to at least minimal empirical evaluation, defined as at least one controlled trial.

Methods We assessed 116 alcohol-dependent adults (53% women; mean age = 37, SD = 8.6) for use of religious coping, general coping, and alcohol use within 2 weeks of entering outpatient treatment, and again 6 months after treatment. Results Religious coping at 6 months predicted fewer heavy alcohol use days and fewer drinks per day. This relationship was no longer significant after controlling for general coping at 6 months.

All rights reserved.Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are on the rise in the United States, and adolescent girls (15-19 years old) are more susceptible to acquiring STIs than their male peers. The co-occurrence of alcohol use and sexual risk taking contribute significantly to STI acquisition. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are ideally suited for our target population and have demonstrated increases in STI testing in young people, as well as reductions in alcohol use. Objective: This pilot study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the views of adolescent girls (age range 15-19 years old; 74.6%, 279/374 white) on the desired qualities and content of an mHealth app for sexual health. Methods: We conducted nine 60-min in-depth interviews (IDIs) to gather information and identify themes of sexual health and alcohol use, and we tested the feasibility of using a two-week social media campaign to collect survey information regarding sexual health risk in adolescent girls. Results: We iteratively coded IDIs and identified major themes around pressure of alcohol use, lack of STI knowledge, male pressure to not use condoms, and pregnancy as a worse outcome than STIs. Results from the web-based survey on risky health behaviors, which was completed by 367 participants, support the use of a sexual health app designed for girls. Conclusions: Future work will integrate these themes to inform the development of a culturally sensitive mHealth app to prevent STIs among adolescent girls.",10.2196/16336,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

The current longitudinal study examined patterns of quitting behavior in adolescent smokers with psychiatric comorbidity. Methods The study evaluated 191 inpatient adolescents who had been enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of motivational interviewing versus brief advice for smoking cessation, and assessed their intentions to quit smoking. Results Rates of quit attempts at post-hospital, 1-month, and 6-month assessments were 23%, 17%, and 17%, respectively. Adolescents who reported an intention to quit smoking (43%) were significantly more likely to report a quit attempt, regardless of psychiatric symptoms, cognitive factors, or substance use. Conclusions Intention to quit smoking appears to translate to substantial quit behavior, even in a high-risk adolescent population that may otherwise be viewed as uninterested in quitting, suggesting the need to proactively connect this population with adequate services and follow-up support. © American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry.",10.1111/j.1521-0391.2013.12067.x,Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Aims: To examine the efficacy of an intervention based on the principles of interpersonal therapy (IPT) in reducing the risk of PPD in pregnant women. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 205 pregnant women who were 18 years old or older, on public assistance, and at risk for PPD. Participants (mean age=23; 38% Hispanic and 23% Black) were randomized to either the IPT group intervention (n=104) or the treatment as usual control (TAU) program (n=101). Results: At 6 months, the overall depression rate in the intervention group (16%) was lower than the control group (31%) and the effect of the intervention was statistically significant at p<0.05. Limitations: It is unknown if findings will generalize to a more heterogeneous sample of women than the current study, such as women from a range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, or marital status. There was a differential amount of contact between TAU and intervention conditions. Conclusions: An IPT based intervention during the prenatal period has the potential to reduce cases of PPD within 6 months postpartum in at risk mothers on public assistance.",10.1016/j.jad.2015.09.059,Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

STIs can lead to a number of serious health risks including premature birth, low birth weight, ectopic pregnancy, and fetal death. Similarly, there has been a dramatic increase in substance use during pregnancy, leading to complications during pregnancy and poorer birth outcomes. Women who misuse substances are disproportionately more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors that can result in STIs. The proposed study will test whether the Health Check-Up for Expectant Moms (HCEM), a computer-delivered brief intervention that simultaneously targets STI risk and alcohol/illicit drug use during pregnancy, reduces antenatal and postpartum risk more than an attention, time, and information matched control condition among pregnant women seeking prenatal care. The study is a two-group, randomized controlled trial in which a diverse sample of 250 pregnant women will be recruited from prenatal care clinics and assigned to either (a) a computer-delivered, single-session brief intervention plus two booster sessions); or (b) a computer-delivered control condition. Follow-up assessments will occur at 2 and 6 months from baseline, and at 6 weeks postpartum. Our objective measures include STI incidence and birth outcomes. The results of this trial will fill a critical gap and provide much-needed data on the efficacy, costs, and resource utilization of a practical computer-delivered, brief motivational intervention tailored to reach high-risk women during pregnancy and extending impact to postpartum.",10.1016/j.cct.2019.105827,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Despite governmental regulations related to distribution and sale, SC variants are still available online. More research is needed to determine SC use prevalence and factors associated with SC use, especially among young adults. Methods: One thousand eighty individuals, 18-25 years old, were surveyed, between January 2012 and July 2013, during recruitment for a randomized controlled trial investigating health behaviors in young adults. Advertisements were placed online and in community locations seeking individuals ""who had recently used marijuana or alcohol."" Respondents were queried about their use of alcohol and drugs, including SCs, in the last month. Results: Participants averaged 21.4 years old and were 53.4% male. Nearly 59% were non-Hispanic white, 15% were African American, 15% were Hispanic, and 11% identified as other. Approximately 9% reported SC use in the last month, a level higher than the reported use of opioids, cocaine, or hallucinogens. SC use was significantly associated with male gender, not being enrolled in school, and with use of cigarettes, binge alcohol drinking, daily and weekly marijuana use, and other drugs of abuse. There was a significant decrease in SC use after the federal ban in July 2012. Conclusions: SC use was common in the past month and often overlaps with other drug use, particularly marijuana use, and should be asked about during clinical encounters with young adults.",10.1080/08897077.2014.959151,Butler Hospital,0000-0001-7658-1719,6507170774.0,

Acupuncture is relatively common in Japan, but no previous research has evaluated its use in rural Japanese populations. Objective: To evaluate the use of acupuncture in rural Japanese populations. Design: By using a Japanese version of the International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q), a cross-sectional survey was conducted in three family medicine clinics in rural Japan. This work extends findings of a previous study about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in general to focus specifically on acupuncture use. Participants: Patients and visitors to the three clinic sites were invited to participate. Results: Of the 340 respondents who answered questions regarding acupuncture, 29 were categorized as acupuncture users (8.5%). Acupuncture users were less likely to have a higher education degree (26% vs. 49%; P = 0.05) and had worse self-rated health scores (P = 0.08) than nonusers. A higher proportion of users had neurologic (28% vs. 11%; P = 0.02) and gynecologic (24% vs. 12%, P = 0.06) health problems. Acupuncture users were more likely to use other CAM treatments and see other CAM providers. Conclusions: Acupuncture use is relatively common in rural Japanese populations. As in previous studies, individuals with chronic illnesses were more likely to use acupuncture. These data fill a gap in the literature regarding acupuncture use in rural Japan and reinforces the notion that primary care providers in rural Japan should familiarize themselves with acupuncture and the indications for acupuncture use.",10.1089/acu.2015.1162,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,56386143300.0,

The purpose of this study was to develop and distribute a Japanese version of the International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q) to assess the use of CAM among people who visit rural Japanese family medicine clinics.Methods: Using a Japanese version of the International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q), a cross-sectional survey was conducted in three rural family medicine clinics. All patients and those accompanying patients who met inclusion criteria were eligible to participate. Data were entered into SPSS Statistics and analyzed for use by age, gender, and location.Results: Of the 519 respondents who participated in the project, 415 participants reported CAM use in the past 12 months (80.0%). When prayer is excluded, the prevalence of CAM use drops to 77.3% in the past year, or 403 respondents. The most common forms of CAM used by respondents were pain relief pads (n = 170, 32.8%), herbal medicines/supplements (n = 167, 32.2%), and massage by self or family (n = 166, 32.0%). Female respondents, individuals with higher levels of education, and those with poorer overall health status were more likely to use CAM than respondents without these characteristics. Only 22.8% of CAM therapies used were reported to physicians by survey participants.Conclusions: These data indicate that CAM use in rural Japan is common. The results are consistent with previous studies that show that Japanese individuals are more interested in forms of CAM such as pain relief pads and massage, than in mind-body forms of CAM like relaxation and meditation. Due to the high utilization of certain CAM practices, and given that most CAM users do not disclose their CAM use to their doctors, we conclude that physicians in rural Japan would benefit by asking about CAM use during patient interviews, and by familiarizing themselves with the potential benefits and risks of commonly used CAM modalities.",10.1186/1472-6882-14-360,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,56386143300.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increasing the diversity of family medicine residency programs includes matriculating residents with disabilities. Ac-crediting agencies and associations provide mandates and recommendations to assist programs with building inclusive policies and practices. The purpose of this study was (1) to assess programs’ compliance with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandates and alignment with Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) best practices; (2) to understand perceptions of sources of accommodation funding; and (3) to docu-ment family medicine chairs’ primary source of disability-related information. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the 2019 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance Chairs’ Survey. Respondents answered questions about disability policy, disability disclosure structure, source of accommodation funding, and source of information regarding dis-ability. RESULTS: Half (56%) of responding chairs reported maintaining a disability policy in alignment with ACGME mandates, while half (52%) maintain a disability disclosure structure in opposition to AAMC recommendations. Funding sources for accommodation were reported as unknown (32.9%), the hospital system (27.1%), or the departmental budget (24.3%). Chairs listed human resources (50.7%) or diversity, equity, and inclusion offices (23.9%) as the main sources of disability guidance. CONCLUSIONS: The number of students with disabilities in medical education is growing, increasing the likelihood that family medicine residency programs will select and train residents with disabilities. Results from this study suggest an urgent need to review disability policy and processes within departments to ensure alignment with current guidance on disability inclu-sion.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Leading medical organizations including the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) espouse the value of a diverse physician workforce, including disability, yet there is a dearth of research about this population in graduate medical education (GME). More information is needed on the prevalence of disability in the resident population, plans to recruit residents with disabilities, and program perceptions of barriers to inclusion. The goal of this study was to better understand the prevalence of disability in the resident population, plans to recruit residents with disabilities, and program perceptions of barriers to disability inclusion and frequency of disability-related complaints and litigation. METHODS: Surveys were emailed to 200 department chairs via SurveyMon-key as part of a larger omnibus survey conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA). RESULTS: More than 30% of family medicine programs reported at least one faculty member with a disability, while 50% reported matriculating at least one resident with a disability in the previous 5 years. Programs with greater num-bers of physicians with disabilities were more likely to have a plan to recruit residents with disabilities, and inadequate expertise was the largest perceived barrier to disability inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Employing faculty with disabilities may be the driving force for having an active plan to recruit residents with disabilities. In order to meet the stated diversity goals of medicine, programs will need to increase profes-sional development around disability inclusion.",10.22454/FamMed.2021.616867,University of Michigan Medical School,,57215893978.0,

Factors impacting hypoglycemia self-management behaviors (including reduced ability to detect hypoglycemia symptoms and unhelpful hypoglycemia beliefs) can lead to hypoglycemia development in people with T1D who use advanced diabetes technology. Objective: This study aims to develop a scalable, personalized mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention program to improve hypoglycemia self-management and ultimately reduce hypoglycemia in people with T1D who use advanced diabetes technology. Methods: We (a multidisciplinary team, including clinical and health psychologists, diabetes care and education specialists, endocrinologists, mHealth interventionists and computer engineers, qualitative researchers, and patient partners) jointly developed an mHealth text messaging hypoglycemia behavioral intervention program based on user-centered design principles. The following five iterative steps were taken: (1) conceptualization of hypoglycemia self-management processes and relevant interventions, (2) identification of text message themes and message content development, (3) message revision, (4) patient partner assessments for message readability, language acceptability, and trustworthiness, and (5) message finalization and integration with a CGM data–connected mHealth SMS text message delivery platform. An mHealth web-based SMS text message delivery platform that communicates with a CGM glucose information-sharing platform was also developed. Results: The mHealth SMS text messaging hypoglycemia behavioral intervention program HypoPals, directed by patients’ own CGM data, delivers personalized intervention messages to (1) improve hypoglycemia symptom detection and (2) elicit self-reflection, provide fact-based education, and suggest practical health behaviors to address unhelpful hypoglycemia beliefs and promote hypoglycemia self-management. The program is designed to message patients up to 4 times per day over a 10-week period. Conclusions: A rigorous conceptual framework, a multidisciplinary team (including patient partners), and behavior change techniques were incorporated to create a scalable, personalized mHealth SMS text messaging behavioral intervention.

Statistical analysis was performed to assess the presentation of severe and level 2 hypoglycemia and identify associated risk factors. RESULTS A total of 289 participants were recruited (including 257 participants with CGM data within the last 3 months). Of these, 25.6% experienced at least one severe hypoglycemic episode in the last 6 months, and 13.6% presented with ‡1% of time in level 2 hypoglycemia on CGMs. Reporting beliefs about prioritizing hyper-glycemia avoidance was associated with severe hypoglycemia development (P < 0.001), while having beliefs of minimal concerns for hypoglycemia was associated with spending ‡1% of time in level 2 hypoglycemia (P = 0.038).

Glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, mindful-eating, self-efficacy, dietary consumption, physical activity, and medication adherence were assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 16. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANCOVA, Repeated Measures ANOVA, and Independent t-test. The findings showed that participants receiving the intervention improved more between baseline and both weeks 12 and 16 in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, appropriate dietary consumption, amount of physical activity, medication adherence, mindful eating, and self-efficacy than those in the control group. Nurses can be trained to implement this intervention program in adults with uncontrolled diabetes. However, more studies with a larger number of community participants are recommended with the application of advanced technology such as mobile health.",,Mahidol University,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,

Objectives: (1) Determine the feasibility of a factorial trial testing patient activation and clinician outreach to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk in patients prescribed warfarin–antiplatelet therapy without proton pump inhibitor gastroprotection and (2) assess intervention acceptability. Methods: Pragmatic 2 × 2 factorial cluster-randomized controlled pilot comparing (1) a patient activation booklet vs usual care and (2) clinician notification vs clinician notification plus nurse facilitation was performed. The primary feasibility outcome was percentage of patients completing a structured telephone assessment after 5 weeks. Exploratory outcomes, including effectiveness, were evaluated using chart review, surveys, and semistructured interviews. Results: Among 47 eligible patients, 35/47 (74.5%; 95% CI, 58.6%-85.7%) met the feasibility outcome. In the subset confirmed to be high risk for upper GI bleeding, 11/29 (37.9%; 95% CI, 16.9%-64.7%) made a medication change, without differences between intervention arms. In interviews, few patients reported reviewing the activation booklet; barriers included underestimating GI bleeding risk, misunderstanding the booklet's purpose, and receiving excessive health communication materials. Clinicians responded to notification messages for 24/47 patients (51.1%; 95% CI, 26.4%-75.4%), which was lower for surgeons than nonsurgeons (22.7% vs 76.0%). Medical specialists but not surgeons viewed clinician notification as acceptable. Conclusion: The proposed trial design and outcome ascertainment strategy were feasible, but the patient activation intervention is unlikely to be effective as designed. While clinician notification appears promising, it may not be acceptable to surgeons, findings which support further refinement and testing of a clinician notification intervention.",10.1016/j.rpth.2024.102421,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,

We evaluated FAMS' effects on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and intervention targets among adults with type 2 diabetes in a 15-month RCT. Methods: Persons with diabetes (PWDs) were randomized to FAMS or control with their support person (family/friend, optional). FAMS included monthly phone coaching and text messages for PWDs, and text messages for support persons over a 9-month intervention period. Results: PWDs (N = 329) were 52 % male, 39 % reported minoritized race or ethnicity, with mean HbA1c 8.6 ± 1.7 %. FAMS improved HbA1c among PWDs with a non-cohabitating support person (-0.64 %; 95 % CI [−1.22 %, −0.05 %]), but overall mean effects were not significant. FAMS improved intervention targets including self-efficacy, dietary behavior, and family/friend involvement during the intervention period; these improvements mediated post-intervention HbA1c improvements (total indirect effect −0.27 %; 95 % CI [−0.49 %, −0.09 %]) and sustained HbA1c improvements at 12 months (total indirect effect −0.19 %; 95 % CI [−0.40 %, −0.01 %]). Conclusions: Despite improvements in most intervention targets, HbA1c improved only among PWDs engaging non-cohabitating support persons suggesting future family interventions should emphasize inclusion of these relationships.

This information is not readily available, and there is a paucity of pragmatic approaches to automatically identifying caregiver availability and type. Objective: Our main objective was to use medical notes to assess caregiver availability and type for hospitalized patients with dementia. Our second objective was to identify whether the patient lived at home or resided at an institution. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used 2016-2019 telephone-encounter medical notes from a single institution to develop a rule-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify the patient’s caregiver availability and place of residence. Using note-level data, we compared the results of the NLP algorithm with human-conducted chart abstraction for both training (749/976, 77%) and test sets (227/976, 23%) for a total of 223 adults aged 65 years and older diagnosed with dementia. Our outcomes included determining whether the patients (1) reside at home or in an institution, (2) have a formal caregiver, and (3) have an informal caregiver. Results: Test set results indicated that our NLP algorithm had high level of accuracy and reliability for identifying whether patients had an informal caregiver (F1=0.94, accuracy=0.95, sensitivity=0.97, and specificity=0.93), but was relatively less able to identify whether the patient lived at an institution (F1=0.64, accuracy=0.90, sensitivity=0.51, and specificity=0.98). The most common explanations for NLP misclassifications across all categories were (1) incomplete or misspelled facility names; (2) past, uncertain, or undecided status; (3) uncommon abbreviations; and (4) irregular use of templates. Conclusions: This innovative work was the first to use medical notes to pragmatically determine caregiver availability. Our NLP algorithm identified whether hospitalized patients with dementia have a formal or informal caregiver and, to a lesser extent, whether they lived at home or in an institutional setting. There is merit in using NLP to identify caregivers. This study serves as a proof of concept. Future work can use other approaches and further identify caregivers and the extent of their availability.",10.2196/40241,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,1856339.0

Design: Single-arm prospective pilot study. Setting: We recruited participants using medical records from an academic medical center. Patient(s): Twenty-nine overweight or obese women (body mass index, 25–50 kg/m2) with PCOS. Intervention(s): We taught participants to follow a VLC diet and provided information about a variety of behavioral skills including mindfulness and positive affect using an online 16-week intervention. Main Outcome Measure(s): Changes in body weight, glycated hemoglobin, and PCOS-related quality of life. Result(s): The intervention led to positive health outcomes including decreases in percent weight (mean difference = −7.67, SD = 6.10) and glycated hemoglobin level (mean difference = −0.21%, SD = 0.27), an increase in sex hormone binding globulin level (mean difference = 9.24 nmol/L, SD = 16.34), and increases in PCOS-related quality of life measures, including menstrual predictability (mean difference = 2.10, SD = 2.76) and body hair (mean difference = 1.14, SD = 1.04). The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased (mean difference = 0.23 mmol/L, SD = 0.49).

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Background: Adults with type 2 diabetes may experience health benefits, including glycemic control and weight loss, from following a very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic (VLC) diet. However, it is unclear which ancillary strategies may enhance these effects. Objective: This pilot study aims to estimate the effect sizes of 3 intervention enhancement strategies (text messages, gifts, and breath vs urine ketone self-monitoring) that may improve outcomes of a 12-month web-based ad libitum VLC diet and lifestyle intervention for adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary intervention also included other components to improve adherence and well-being, including positive affect and mindfulness as well as coaching. Methods: Overweight or obese adults (n=44; BMI 25-45 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] ≥6.5%), who had been prescribed either no glucose-lowering medications or metformin alone, participated in a 12-month web-based intervention. Using a 2×2×2 randomized factorial design, we compared 3 enhancement strategies: (1) near-daily text messages about the intervention's recommended behaviors (texts n=22 vs no texts n=22), (2) mailed gifts of diet-relevant foods and cookbooks (6 rounds of mailed gifts n=21 vs no gifts n=23), and (3) urine- or breath-based ketone self-monitoring (urine n=21 vs breath n=23). We assessed HbA1c and weight at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 months. We evaluated whether each strategy exerted a differential impact on HbA1c and weight at 12 months against an a priori threshold of Cohen d of 0.5 or greater. Results: We retained 73% (32/44) of the participants at 12 months. The intervention, across all conditions, led to improvements in glucose control and reductions in body weight at the 12-month follow-up. In intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the mean HbA1c reduction was 1.0% (SD 1.6) and the mean weight reduction was 5.3% (SD 6.0), whereas among study completers, these reductions were 1.2% (SD 1.7) and 6.3% (SD 6.4), respectively, all with a P value of less than.001. In ITT analyses, no enhancement strategy met the effect size threshold. Considering only study completers, 2 strategies showed a differential effect size of at least a d value of 0.5 or greater Conclusions: Text messages, gifts of food and cookbooks, and urine-based ketone self-monitoring may potentially enhance the glycemic or weight loss benefits of a web-based VLC diet and lifestyle intervention for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Future research could investigate other enhancement strategies to help create even more effective solutions for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",10.2196/15835,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,
James Edwin Aikens,Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Identify Caregiver Availability for Patients with ADRD from Electronic Medical Records,2022.0,Alzheimer's and Dementia,Note,Medical Records; Language; Medical Records; Language,"2022 the Alzheimer's Association.Background: Prior literature has posited that caregiver availability can potentially prevent adverse health events such as hospital readmissions in the ADRD population. Identifying caregiver availability for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) can inform healthcare systems and hospital administrations on appropriate discharge planning. Caregiver availability is an important and influential domain in assessing risk of hospital readmissions. However, caregiver availability data is not systematically collected in our healthcare system. Our main objective was to use medical notes (from physicians, nurses, or social workers) to assess caregiver availability and types of caregivers for hospitalized patients with ADRD. Method: We used 2016-2019 telephone-encounter medical notes from a single institution. Rule-based natural language processing (NLP) was used to develop an algorithm to identify whether the patient (1) resides at home; (2) resides at an institution; (3) has a formal caregiver; and (4) has an informal caregiver. We evaluated the data at the patient level. We used chart abstraction as the “gold standard,” and examined the validity of the algorithm for both training (n = 749) and test sets (n = 227). Result: The result from our test set indicated a high level of accuracy and reliability for identifying an informal caregiver (F1 = 0.942; accuracy = 0.947, sensitivity = 0.970, and specificity = 0.928). Identifying whether the patient lived at an institution was the least reliable measure (F1 = 0.638, accuracy = 0.899, sensitivity = 0.512, specificity = 0.978). The most common causes of misclassifications were: (1) incomplete or misspelled names of the facilities; (2) past/uncertain/undecided situations; (3) lack of specificity; (4) use of uncommon abbreviations; and (5) irregular use of templates. Conclusion: Our NLP algorithm was able to identify whether the patient lived at home vs. an institution and whether the patient had a formal or informal caregiver. There is merit in continuing the NLP approach to identify more granular, caregiver-related information (e.g., type, hours available, etc.). More effort is needed towards generalizing the algorithm. This information can be used by other healthcare systems to detect ADRD patients who do not have a caregiver at home and may be at risk of adverse events including readmission.",10.1002/alz.064646,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,6953599.0

Diet and lifestyle programs improve health, but women's preferences for these programs have not been formally explored. Objective: The aim of our study was to examine diet and lifestyle program preferences among women with PCOS. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of women with PCOS. Results: At least half of the 197 respondents expressed strong interest in programs addressing energy level, anxiety, depression, weight, diabetes prevention, menstrual period regulation, and hirsutism. Similarly, at least half reported willingness to modify their sleep, stress, and physical activity; and slightly less than half reported willingness to adopt a very low-carbohydrate, paleo, or low-glycemic index diet. At least half reported interest in online or mobile programs and email-based mentoring. Younger age was associated with interest in help with acne and fertility; higher body mass index was associated with wanting help with weight loss, energy, and anxiety; and greater stress eating was associated with wanting help with depression, anxiety, and menstrual period regulation. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine attitudes and preferences of women with PCOS toward such programs. Future online and mobile diet and lifestyle programs may be able to capitalize on this information to better target this population's expressed preferences.",10.2196/17126,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction â € Task-shifting' or â € task-sharing' is an effective strategy for delivering behavioural healthcare in lower resource communities. However, little is known regarding the actual steps (methods) in carrying out a task-shifting project. This paper presents a protocol for a systematic review that will identify steps in adapting an evidence-based psychological treatment for delivery by lay/non-licenced personnel. Methods and analysis A systematic review of peer-reviewed, published studies involving a non-licenced, non-specialist (eg, community health worker, promotor/a, peer and lay person) delivering an evidence-based psychological treatment for adults will be conducted. Study design of selected articles must include a statistical comparison (eg, randomised controlled trials, quasiexperimental trials, pre-post designs and pragmatic trials). Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, APA PsycInfo and Google Scholar will be searched from 2000 to 2020. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias (RoB 2) tool, and publication bias will be evaluated with the Cochrane GRADE approach. A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies, and a summary table following Proctor's framework for operationalising implementation strategies will be included. This protocol was developed following the 2015 guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. Ethics and dissemination This review will analyse data from published studies only; thus, it will not require institutional board review. Findings will be presented at conferences, to the broader community via the Community Health Worker Translational Advisory Board and social media, and the final systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044012,The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,

Published by BMJ.Introduction Multiple eating patterns can promote glycaemic control and weight loss among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Clinical practice guidelines for T2D management encourage health professionals to guide patients' selection of a patient-centred eating pattern. This study aims to characterise beliefs about and recommendations for and against practice guideline-concordant eating patterns among registered dietitians (RDs) and other healthcare professionals who provide nutrition counselling to patients with T2D. Methods This was a cross-sectional online survey. We invited 82 RDs affiliated with an academic health system in the midwestern USA to participate. We also invited health professionals who provide nutrition counselling to patients with T2D and are affiliated with 264 primary care practices within the Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes. Participants were asked to select the eating pattern(s) that they commonly recommend or avoid for patients with T2D and why. Results Survey respondents (n=81) most commonly recommend low-carbohydrate (77.8%); Mediterranean-style (52.8%) and energy-modified/calorie-restricted (36.1%) eating patterns. Survey respondents most commonly recommend avoiding very low-carbohydrate (51.0%) and very low-calorie (49.0%) eating patterns. Respondents who did not recommend very low-carbohydrate were most concerned about the eating pattern being too restrictive (93.0%). Conclusions Survey respondents recommend a range of guideline-adherent eating patterns to patients with T2D but tend to recommend against very low-carbohydrate and very low-calorie eating patterns. Additional strategies are needed to increase patient-centred use of these evidence-based options in clinical practice settings.,10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000845,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,

Requiring SP coparticipation can challenge recruitment and bias samples; however, the associations between voluntary SP coparticipation and recruitment outcomes across patient characteristics are unknown. Methods: The Family/Friend Activation to Motivate Self-care 2.0 randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled adults with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) from an academic health system. Participants were asked—but not required—to invite an SP to coenroll. Using data from the electronic health record we sought to describe RCT enrollment in the setting of voluntary SP coparticipation. Results: In a diverse sample of adults with (T2D) (48% female, 44% minoritized race/ethnicity), most participants (91%) invited SPs and (89%) enrolled with SPs. However, prerandomization withdrawal was significantly higher among participants who did not have consenting SPs than those who did.

Current PCOS treatments insufficiently address the spectrum and severity of the disorder, and there is little evidence-based guidance available for lifestyle management of PCOS, especially through nutritional approaches. Some evidence shows that a very low-carbohydrate diet can improve glucose control compared to low-fat or moderate-carbohydrate diets, leading to improved glucose control and insulin levels that may help to treat symptoms of PCOS. This research investigates whether a very low-carbohydrate diet is more effective in improving glucose control and decreasing symptoms of PCOS in comparison to a DASH diet. Methods: The SUPER study aims to address the gap in knowledge about nutritional advice for people with PCOS through a randomized, comparative effectiveness trial comparing two approaches to glucose control: the dietary approaches to stopping hypertension (DASH) diet, and a very low-carbohydrate (VLC) diet. We will randomize 184 women with PCOS with body mass indexes (BMIs) between 25 and 50 kg/m2 to a VLC or DASH diet. All participants will follow a 24-session, 12-month, online diet, and lifestyle intervention that teaches their assigned diet. Participants will receive nutritional education, support from diet coaches, and education about behavioral strategies to improve dietary adherence. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c, and secondary outcomes include glucose variance, lipid and hormone levels (including total and free testosterone), PCOS symptoms, inflammation (measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), body composition and weight, psychological well-being, and intervention feasibility and acceptability. Discussion: The SUPER study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial that compares two promising approaches to glucose control in people with PCOS. The study also aims to assess the effects of each diet on PCOS symptoms. The research addresses an important gap in knowledge regarding nutritional advice for people with PCOS.

However, the supplementary behavioral strategies that might be able to improve outcomes using this nutritional strategy are uncertain. Objective: This study aims to compare the impact of adding 3 different supplementary behavioral strategies to a web-based VLC diet intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to randomize participants to different frequencies of dietary self-monitoring. Methods: The study included 112 overweight adults with T2D (hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%) taking no antiglycemic medications or only metformin. They received a remotely delivered 12-month VLC diet intervention. Participants were randomly assigned through a full factorial 2×2×2 design to supplementary strategies: either daily or monthly dietary self-monitoring, either mindful eating training or not, and either positive affect skills training or not. Our research goal was to determine whether 3 different supplemental strategies had at least a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.5). Results: Overall, the VLC intervention led to statistically significant improvements in glycemic control (-0.70%, 95% CI -1.04% to -0.35%; P<.001), weight loss (-6.82%, 95% CI -8.57% to -5.08%; P<.001), and depressive symptom severity (Cohen d -0.67, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.41; P<.001). Furthermore, 30% (25/83) of the participants taking metformin at baseline reduced or discontinued their metformin. Only 1 Cohen d point estimate reached 0.5; daily (vs monthly) dietary self-monitoring had a worse impact on depressive symptoms severity (Cohen d=0.47, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.95; P=.06). None of the strategies had a statistically significant effect on outcomes. For changes in our primary outcome, hemoglobin A1c, the daily (vs monthly) dietary self-monitoring impact was 0.42% (95% CI -0.28% to 1.12%); for mindful eating, it was -0.47% (95% CI -1.15% to 0.22%); and for positive affect, it was 0.12% (95% CI -0.57% to 0.82%). Other results for daily (vs monthly) dietary self-monitoring were mixed, suggesting an increase in weight (0.98%) and depressive symptoms (Cohen d=0.47), less intervention satisfaction (Cohen d=-0.20), more sessions viewed (3.02), and greater dietary adherence (Cohen d=0.24). For mindful eating, the results suggested a benefit for dietary adherence (Cohen d=0.24) and intervention satisfaction (Cohen d=0.30). For positive affect, the results suggested a benefit for depressive symptoms (Cohen d=-0.32), the number of sessions viewed (3.68), dietary adherence (Cohen d=0.16), and intervention satisfaction (Cohen d=0.25). Conclusions: Overall, our results support the use of a VLC diet intervention in adults with T2D. The addition of monthly (not daily) dietary self-monitoring, mindful eating, and positive affect skills training did not show a definitive benefit, but it is worth further testing.",10.2196/44295,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,
James Edwin Aikens,"Rationale, design, and recruitment outcomes for the Family/Friend Activation to Motivate Self-care (FAMS) 2.0 randomized controlled trial among adults with type 2 diabetes and their support persons",2022.0,Contemporary Clinical Trials,Article,Diabetes distress; Family intervention; Glycemic control; Social support; Type 2 diabetes; Diabetes distress; Family intervention; Glycemic control; Social support; Type 2 diabetes,"2022 Elsevier Inc.Background: Self-care behaviors help reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes (T2D) complications. Individualized interventions that support goal setting and self-monitoring improve self-care and HbA1c in the short-term; engaging family and friends may enhance and/or sustain effects. Family/Friend Activation to Motivate Self-care (FAMS) is a mobile phone-delivered intervention (i.e., phone coaching and text message support) based on Family Systems Theory which was successfully piloted among diverse adults with T2D. Methods: We made improvements to FAMS and conducted iterative usability testing to finalize FAMS 2.0 before evaluation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Adult persons with diabetes (PWDs) who enrolled were asked to invite a support person (friend or family member) to participate alongside them. For the RCT, dyads were randomly assigned to FAMS 2.0 or enhanced treatment as usual (control) for the first 9 months of the 15-month trial. Outcomes include PWDs' HbA1c and psychosocial well-being (including diabetes distress) and support persons' own diabetes distress and support burden. Results: We recruited RCT participants from April 2020 through October 2021 (N = 338 PWDs with T2D; 89% [n = 300] with a support person). PWDs were 52% male, 62% non-Hispanic White, aged 56.9 ± 11.0 years with HbA1c 8.7% ± 1.7% at enrollment; 73% cohabitated with their enrolled support person. Data collection is ongoing through January 2023. Conclusion: Findings will inform the utility of engaging family/friends in self-care behaviors for both PWD and support person outcomes. Using widely available mobile phone technology, FAMS 2.0, if successful, has potential for scalability.

James Edwin Aikens,Readmission Rates and Episode Costs for Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias Across Hospitals in a Statewide Collaborative,2023.0,JAMA Network Open,Article,Dementia; Dementia,"2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.Importance: There has been a paucity of research examining the risk and cost of readmission among patients with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) after a planned hospitalization for a broad set of medical and surgical procedures. Objective: To examine 30-day readmission rates and episode costs, including readmission costs, for patients with ADRD compared with their counterparts without ADRD across Michigan hospitals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used 2012 to 2017 Michigan Value Collaborative data across different medical and surgical services stratified by ADRD diagnosis. A total of 66676 admission episodes of care that occurred between January 1, 2012, and June 31, 2017, were identified for patients with ADRD using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic codes for ADRD, along with 656235 admission episodes in patients without ADRD. Using a generalized linear model framework, this study risk adjusted, price standardized, and performed episode payment winsorization. Payments were risk adjusted for age, sex, Hierarchical Condition Categories, insurance type, and prior 6-month payments. Selection bias was accounted for using multivariable logistic regression with propensity score matching without replacement using calipers. Data analysis was performed from January to December 2019. Exposure: Presence of ADRD. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were 30-day readmission rate at the patient and county levels, 30-day readmission cost, and 30-day total episode cost across 28 medical and surgical services. Results: The study included 722911 hospitalization episodes, of which 66676 were related to patients with ADRD (mean [SD] age, 83.4 [8.6] years; 42 439 [63.6%] female) and 656235 were related to patients without ADRD (mean [SD] age, 66.0 [15.4] years; 351 246 [53.5%] female). After propensity score matching, 58629 hospitalization episodes were included for each group. Readmission rates were 21.5% (95% CI, 21.2%-21.8%) for patients with ADRD and 14.7% (95% CI, 14.4%-15.0%) for patients without ADRD (difference, 6.75 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.31-7.19 percentage points). Cost of 30-day readmission was $467 higher (95% CI of difference, $289-$645) among patients with ADRD ($8378; 95% CI, $8263-$8494) than those without ($7912; 95% CI, $7776-$8047). Across all 28 service lines examined, total 30-day episode costs were $2794 higher for patients with ADRD vs patients without ADRD ($22371 vs $19578; 95% CI of difference, $2668-$2919). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with ADRD had higher readmission rates and overall readmission and episode costs than their counterparts without ADRD. Hospitals may need to be better equipped to care for patients with ADRD, especially in the postdischarge period. Considering that any type of hospitalization may put patients with ADRD at a high risk of 30-day readmission, judicious preoperative assessment, postoperative discharge, and care planning are strongly advised for this vulnerable patient population.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.2109,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,6953599.0

Methods: A cross-sectional survey and data collections were completed with 196 T1D adults who used CGM (59% also used automated insulin delivery devices (AIDs)). We assessed hypoglycemia awareness (Gold instrument), hypoglycemia beliefs (Attitudes to Awareness of Hypoglycemia instrument), CGM glycemic profiles, demographics, and anxiety and depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Analysis included simple and multiple linear regression analyses. Results: Lower hypoglycemia awareness, weaker “hypoglycemia concerns minimized” beliefs, stronger “hyperglycemia avoidance prioritized” beliefs were independently associated with higher anxiety symptoms (P < 0.05), with similar trends in both subgroups using and not using AIDs. Lower hypoglycemia awareness were independently associated with greater depression symptoms (P < 0.05). In participants not using AIDs, more time in hypoglycemia was related to less anxiety and depression symptoms (P < 0.05). Being female and younger were independently associated with higher anxiety symptoms, while being younger was also independently associated with greater depression symptoms (P < 0.05).

Methods: We randomized 204 low-income primary care patients who had at least moderate depressive symptoms to intervention or control. Intervention participants received 12 months of weekly automated interactive voice response telephone calls that assessed their symptom severity and provided self-management strategies. Their patient-nominated supporter (CarePartner) received corresponding guidance on self-management support, and their primary care team received urgent notifications. Those randomized to enhanced usual care received printed generic self-management instructions. Results: One-year attrition rate was 14%. By month 6, symptom severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) decreased 2.5 points more in the intervention arm than in the control arm (95% CI -4.2 to -0.8, p = 0.003). This benefit was similar at month 12 (p = 0.004). Intervention was also over twice as likely to lead to =50% reduction in symptom severity by month 6 (OR = 2.2 (1.1, 4.7)) and a decrease of =5 PHQ-9 points by month 12 (OR = 2.3 (1.2, 4.4)). Conclusions: Technology-facilitated self-management guidance with lay support and clinician notifications improves depression for primary care patients.

Only one-third of individuals with T2D receive care as recommended by the American Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines. Effective strategies are needed to accelerate the implementation of guideline concordant T2D care. Methods: The Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D) is a statewide population health collaborative quality initiative (CQI) developed to improve the care of all people with T2D in Michigan. MCT2D has developed a learning health system with physician organizations and their constituent practices to support quality improvement initiatives focused on (1) improving use of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy to improve cardiorenal outcomes, (2) increasing evidence-based use of continuous glucose monitoring, and (3) supporting use of lower carbohydrate eating patterns. Results: Between 2021 and 2022, MCT2D recruited 28 of the 40 Michigan-based physician organizations participating in Blue Cross’ Physician Group Incentive Program with 336 constituent practices and 1357 physicians in primary care (304), endocrinology (21) and nephrology (11). In January 2022, baseline data included a sample of 96,140 unique individuals with T2D. The baseline HbA1c was ≤ 7.0% for 66.3% of patients (n = 32,787), while 14.9% of patients had a most recent HbA1c ≥ 8.0% (n = 7,393). The most recent body mass index (BMI) was ≥ 30.0 for 64.8% of patients (n = 38,516). Discussion: MCT2D has organized a statewide collaborative to recruit and engage a diverse and large set of physician organizations and their constituent practices. This is a promising opportunity to accelerate adoption of guideline-concordant care for people with T2D and may be a model for other state or regional collaboratives. Future directions include specific evidence-based interventions targeted at reducing diabetes-linked comorbidities and associated healthcare costs as well as strategies focused on T2D prevention among at-risk populations.",10.1186/s12913-024-11520-z,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-3795-9018,7004351711.0,

We sought to test the effects of Family/friend Activation to Motivate Self-care (FAMS), a self-care support intervention delivered via mobile phones, on psychosocial outcomes for persons with diabetes (PWDs) and their support persons. Methods: PWDs had the option to enroll with a friend/family member as a support person in a 15-month RCT to evaluate FAMS versus enhanced usual care. FAMS included 9 months of monthly phone coaching and text message support for PWDs, and text message support for enrolled support persons. Results: PWDs (N = 329) were 52% male and 39% reported minoritized race or ethnicity; 50% enrolled with elevated diabetes distress. Support persons (N = 294) were 26% male and 33% reported minoritized race or ethnicity. FAMS improved PWDs’ diabetes distress (d = -0.19) and global well-being (d = 0.21) during the intervention, with patterns of larger effects among minoritized groups. Post-intervention (9-month) and sustained (15-month) improvements were driven by changes in PWDs’ self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and autonomy support. Among support persons, FAMS improved helpful involvement without increasing burden or harmful involvement.

Published by Cambridge University Press.Background: Understanding how cardiovascular structure and physiology guide management is critically important in paediatric cardiology. However, few validated educational tools are available to assess trainee knowledge. To address this deficit, paediatric cardiologists and fellows from four institutions collaborated to develop a multimedia assessment tool for use with medical students and paediatric residents. This tool was developed in support of a novel 3-dimensional virtual reality curriculum created by our group. Methods: Educational domains were identified, and questions were iteratively developed by a group of clinicians from multiple centres to assess understanding of key concepts. To evaluate content validity, content experts completed the assessment and reviewed items, rating item relevance to educational domains using a 4-point Likert scale. An item-level content validity index was calculated for each question, and a scale-level content validity index was calculated for the assessment tool, with scores of ≥0.78 and ≥0.90, respectively, representing excellent content validity. Results: The mean content expert assessment score was 92% (range 88-97%). Two questions yielded ≤50% correct content expert answers. The item-level content validity index for 29 out of 32 questions was ≥0.78, and the scale-level content validity index was 0.92. Qualitative feedback included suggestions for future improvement. Questions with ≤50% content expert agreement and item-level content validity index scores <0.78 were removed, yielding a 27-question assessment tool. Conclusions: We describe a multi-centre effort to create and validate a multimedia assessment tool which may be implemented within paediatric trainee cardiology curricula. Future efforts may focus on content refinement and expansion to include additional educational domains.",10.1017/S1047951122001123,C.S. Mott Children's Hospital,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,

A tool founded on best practices could facilitate simulator purchase processes. Methods: In a 3-phase process, we identified top factors considered during the simulator purchase process through expert consensus (n = 127), created the Simulator Value Index (SVI) tool, evaluated targeted validity evidence, and evaluated the practical value of this SVI. A web-based survey was sent to simulation professionals. Participants (n = 79) used the SVI and provided feedback. We evaluated the practical value of 4 tool variations by calculating their sensitivity to predict a preferred simulator. Results: Seventeen top factors were identified and ranked. The top 2 were technical stability/reliability of the simulator and customer service, with no practical differences in rank across institution or stakeholder role. Full SVI variations predicted successfully the preferred simulator with good (87%) sensitivity, whereas the sensitivity of variations in cost and customer service and cost and technical stability decreased (≤54%). The majority (73%) of participants agreed that the SVI was helpful at guiding simulator purchase decisions, and 88% agreed the SVI tool would help facilitate discussion with peers and leadership. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the SVI supports the process of simulator purchase using a standardized framework. Sensitivity of the tool improved when factors extend beyond traditionally targeted factors. We propose the tool will facilitate discussion amongst simulation professionals dealing with simulation, provide essential information for finance and procurement professionals, and improve the long-term value of simulation solutions.

Instructional approaches were identified and clinical performance patterns analyzed. RESULTS: Alumni ratings of the practice-based curriculum increased following institution of the PCMH model. Clinical performance outcomes indicated improvements in the delivery of clinical care to patients. Implementation of instructional methodologies posed some challenges to residency faculty, particularly in development of consistent scheduling of individualized feedback sessions. Residents required the greatest support and guidance in managing point-of-care clinical reminders during patient encounters.

JACEP Open published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American College of Emergency Physicians.Objective: Intranasal medications have been proposed as adjuncts to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) care. We sought to quantify the effects of intranasal medication administration (INMA) in OHCA workflows. Methods: We conducted separate randomized OHCA simulation trials with lay rescuers (LRs) and first responders (FRs). Participants were randomized to groups performing hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)/automated external defibrillator with or without INMA during the second analysis phase. Time to compression following the second shock (CPR2) was the primary outcome and compression quality (chest compression rate (CCR) and fraction (CCF)) was the secondary outcome. We fit linear regression models adjusted for CPR training in the LR group and service years in the FR group. Results: Among LRs, INMA was associated with a significant increase in CPR2 (mean diff. 44.1 s, 95% CI: 14.9, 73.3), which persisted after adjustment (p = 0.005). We observed a significant decrease in CCR (INMA 95.1 compressions per min (cpm) vs control 104.2 cpm, mean diff. −9.1 cpm, 95% CI −16.6, −1.6) and CCF (INMA 62.4% vs control 69.8%, mean diff. −7.5%, 95% CI −12.0, −2.9). Among FRs, we found no significant CPR2 delays (mean diff. −2.1 s, 95% CI −15.9, 11.7), which persisted after adjustment (p = 0.704), or difference in quality (CCR INMA 115.5 cpm vs control 120.8 cpm, mean diff. −5.3 cpm, 95% CI −12.6, 2.0; CCF INMA 79.6% vs control 81.2% mean diff. −1.6%, 95% CI −7.4, 4.3%).

A common barrier to the prompt initiation of compressions is moving victims to the floor, but compression quality on a “floor” versus a “mattress” has not been tested among lay bystanders. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, cross-over trial comparing lay bystander compression quality using a manikin on a bed versus the floor. Participants included adults without professional health care training. We randomized participants to the order of manikin placement, either on a mattress or on the floor. For both, participants were instructed to perform 2 minutes of chest compressions on a cardiopulmonary resuscitation Simon manikin Gaumard (Gaumard Scientific, Miami, FL). The primary outcome was mean compression depth (cm) over 2 minutes. We fit a linear regression model adjusted for scenario order, age, sex, and body mass index with robust standard errors to account for repeated measures and reported mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Our sample of 80 adults was 66% female with a mean age of 50.5 years (SD 18.2). The mean compression depth on the mattress was 2.9 cm (SD 2.3) and 3.5 cm (SD 2.2) on the floor, a mean difference of 0.58 cm (95% CI 0.18, 0.98). Compression depth fell below the 5 to 6 cm depth recommended by the American Heart Association on both surfaces. In the adjusted model, the mean depth was greater when the manikin was on the floor than the mattress (adjusted mean difference 0.62 cm; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01), and mean depth was less for females than males (adjusted mean difference –1.42 cm, 95% CI –2.59, –0.25). In addition, the difference in compression depth was larger for female participants (mean difference 0.94 cm; 95% CI 0.54, 1.34) than for male participants (mean difference –0.01 cm; 95% CI –0.80, 0.78), and the interaction was statistically significant (P =.04). Conclusion: The mean compression depth was significantly smaller on the mattress and with female bystanders.

James Matthew Cooke,Immune complexes bound to the primate erythrocyte complement receptor (CR1) via anti-CR1 mAbs are cleared simultaneously with loss of CR1 in a concerted reaction in a rhesus monkey model,1997.0,Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology,Article,Ear,"In the circulation of primates, C3b-opsonized immune complexes (IC) bound to erythrocyte (E) CR1 are taken to the liver and spleen where IC are removed and destroyed without lysis or sequestration of E. Individuals with diseases associated with IC processing often have decreased E CR1 levels, and in previous primate animal models of IC disease, E CR1 was shown to be reduced, but the relationship between IC processing and CR1 loss remained to be clarified. We have developed a simple model to study this question. In naive (nonimmunized) rhesus monkeys, E-bound mouse anti-CR1 mAbs (1500 IgG/E) are not rapidly cleared from the circulation. Infusion of monkey antimouse IgG leads to rapid indirect binding of this second antibody to E CR1. Subsequently, in what appears to be a concerted reaction, CR1-bound nascent IC are rapidly cleared from the circulation and CR1 is removed from E at the same rate. Clearance of bound IC and loss of CR1 were both independently followed by RIA. Imaging studies localized the cleared anti-CR1 mAbs to the liver. Western blots indicated that the loss of CR1 was not due to a conformational change, and E CR1 levels returned to normal in 2-3 weeks, suggesting that the return was associated with synthesis of new E. Our findings suggest that the key step in the clearance mechanism requires recognition (possibly by Fc receptors) of IC-like material associated with E CR1, and this leads to loss of CR1 and uptake of the CR1-IC substrate by liver phagocytic cells.",10.1006/clin.1996.4286,University of Virginia School of Medicine,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,
James Matthew Cooke,Improving diagnostic performance through feedback: the Diagnosis Learning Cycle,2021.0,BMJ Quality &amp; Safety,Article,Ear; Learning; Feedback,"Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.Background Errors in reasoning are a common cause of diagnostic error. However, it is difficult to improve performance partly because providers receive little feedback on diagnostic performance. Examining means of providing consistent feedback and enabling continuous improvement may provide novel insights for diagnostic performance. Methods We developed a model for improving diagnostic performance through feedback using a six-step qualitative research process, including a review of existing models from within and outside of medicine, a survey, semistructured interviews with individuals working in and outside of medicine, the development of the new model, an interdisciplinary consensus meeting, and a refinement of the model. Results We applied theory and knowledge from other fields to help us conceptualise learning and comparison and translate that knowledge into an applied diagnostic context. This helped us develop a model, the Diagnosis Learning Cycle, which illustrates the need for clinicians to be given feedback about both their confidence and reasoning in a diagnosis and to be able to seamlessly compare diagnostic hypotheses and outcomes. This information would be stored in a repository to allow accessibility. Such a process would standardise diagnostic feedback and help providers learn from their practice and improve diagnostic performance. This model adds to existing models in diagnosis by including a detailed picture of diagnostic reasoning and the elements required to improve outcomes and calibration. Conclusion A consistent, standard programme of feedback that includes representations of clinicians' confidence and reasoning is a common element in non-medical fields that could be applied to medicine. Adapting this approach to diagnosis in healthcare is a promising next step. This information must be stored reliably and accessed consistently. The next steps include testing the Diagnosis Learning Cycle in clinical settings.",10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012456,Metropolitan State University,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,
James Matthew Cooke,Institution-Specific Factors Associated With Family Medicine Residency Match Rates,2016.0,Teaching and Learning in Medicine,Article,Family; career choice; curriculum; family medicine; medical school; undergraduate medical education,"2016 Taylor & Francis.Phenomenon: Existing research provides little specific evidence regarding the association between public and private medical school curricular settings and the proportion of medical students matching into family medicine careers. Institutional differences have been inadequately investigated, as students who match into family medicine are often consolidated into the umbrella of primary care along with those matching in internal medicine and pediatrics. However, understanding medical school contexts in relation to career choice is critical toward designing targeted strategies to address the projected shortage of family physicians. This study examines factors associated with family medicine residency match rates and the extent to which such factors differ across medical school settings. Approach: We combined data from a survey of 123 departments of family medicine with graduate placement rates reported to the American Academy of Family Physicians over a 2-year period. Chi-square/Fisher's Exact texts, t tests, and linear regression analyses were used to identify factors significantly associated with average match rate percentages. Findings: The resulting data set included 85% of the U.S. medical schools with Departments of Family Medicine that reported 2011 and 2012 residency match rates in family medicine. Match rates in family medicine were higher among graduates of public than private medical schools—11% versus 7%, respectively, t(92) = 4.00, p <.001. Using a linear regression model and controlling for institutional type, the results indicated 2% higher match rates among schools with smaller annual clerkship enrollments (p =.03), 3% higher match rates among schools with clerkships lasting more than 3 to 4 weeks (p =.003), 3% higher match rates at schools with at least 1 family medicine faculty member in a senior leadership role (p =.04), and 8% lower match rates at private medical schools offering community medicine electives (p <.001, R2 =.48), F(6, 64) = 9.95, p <.001. Three additional factors were less strongly related and varied by institutional type—informal mentoring, ambulatory primary care learning experiences, and institutional research focus. Insights: Educational opportunities associated with higher match rates in family medicine differ across private and public medical schools. Future research is needed to identify the qualitative aspects of educational programming that contribute to differences in match rates across institutional contexts. Results of this study should prove useful in mitigating physician shortages, particularly in primary care fields such as family medicine.",10.1080/10401334.2016.1159565,DMU College of Osteopathic Medicine,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,

James Matthew Cooke,Opportunities for medical student engagement with family medicine,2013.0,Family Medicine,Article,Family,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Several factors have been linked to the decline in medical student choice of a career in pri-mary care (eg, gender, race, family income, student debt), yet un-derstanding remains limited regarding the availability of curricular and co-curricular experiences for medical students within family medicine that may play a role, particularly one-on-one opportuni-ties such as faculty mentoring and advising. Our study sought to collect baseline data on family medicine learning experiences dur-ing predoctoral training. METHODS: An online 21-question survey was sent to family medi-cine departments at US allopathic medical schools between Janu-ary and March 2012 (84.6% response rate) to capture institutional representation and experiences within family medicine. RESULTS: Most institutions reported offering family medicine in-terest groups (98.1%), electives (97.1%), and clerkships (90.4%). Career advising as an elective course component was available at 53.8% of schools and as part of a required course at 46.2%. Com-parison of public versus private institutions revealed differences in rural medicine experiences, admissions preferences, and residency director involvement in hands-on and small-group teaching. Addi-tional differences were noted by total enrollment, number of fam-ily medicine faculty in senior leadership positions, and proportion of full-time clinical faculty teaching family medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of family medicine curricular program-ming, formal advising/mentoring opportunities, and full-time fac-ulty as teachers and senior administrators differed across various characteristics of medical schools.

Acute otitis media is usually a complication of eustachian tube dysfunction that occurs during a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common organisms isolated from middle ear fluid. Management of acute otitis media should begin with adequate analgesia. Antibiotic therapy can be deferred in children two years or older with mild symptoms. High-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day) is the antibiotic of choice for treating acute otitis media in patients who are not allergic to penicillin. Children with persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy should be reexamined, and a second-line agent, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, should be used if appropriate. Otitis media with effusion is defined as middle ear effusion in the absence of acute symptoms. Antibiotics, decongestants, or nasal steroids do not hasten the clearance of middle ear fluid and are not recommended. Children with evidence of anatomic damage, hearing loss, or language delay should be referred to an otolaryngologist.© 2013 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,
James Matthew Cooke,Overarching themes from ACS-AEI accreditation survey best practices 2011–2019,2020.0,Surgery (United States),Article,Chin; Heme; Accreditation,"2020 Elsevier Inc.The American College of Surgeons launched the Accredited Education Institutes (ACS-AEIs) in 2005 to create a network of simulation centers to offer the highest-quality surgical education and training and to pursue cutting-edge scholarship. Specific standards and criteria were developed to accredit simulation centers, and decisions made based on the application, site surveyor visit, and ACS-AEI Accreditation Committee review. In addition to granting accreditation and providing recommendations for improvement, site surveyors and the Accreditation Committee identified best practices defined as areas far exceeding the accreditation standards or novel methods of advancing high-quality, impactful education. Best practices were compiled into a list starting in 2011 for dissemination to all members of the ACS-AEI Consortium through on-line videos, newsletters, and workshops at the Annual ACS Surgical Simulation Summit. Using thematic analysis, the authors classified common themes from the 337 best practices identified during 247 accreditation reviews between June 2011 and June 2019. As best practices were extracted, the authors compiled them into a single database. Eight overarching themes were identified, including approaches to faculty development, scholarly activity, development of curricula, use of resources, delivery of educational content, assessment of learners, and collaboration between centers. The authors discuss themes in the context of their practical relevance and highlight strategies used at different centers, with an emphasis on the importance of each theme in developing a successful simulation program.",10.1016/j.surg.2020.06.022,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,
James Matthew Cooke,"Simulation center best practices: A review of ACS-accredited educational institutes' best practices, 2011 to present",2018.0,Surgery (United States),Article,Education,"2017 Elsevier Inc.Background: Since the inception of American College of Surgeons' Accredited Educational Institute (ACS-AEI) Consortium, accreditation reviews have identified best practices in simulation-based education and center operations. A review of best practices would support the communication of these best practices, offer recognition of exemplar institutes, and facilitate discussion and sharing of resources amongst AEIs. Methods: We examined 5 years of ACS AEI accreditation best practices identified across all standards and criteria. The goal was to identify resources that could be shared among AEIs and recognize AEI champions that have promoted best practices in surgical simulation. Results: From 149 site reviews (July 2011–June 2016), reviewers identified 197 best practices across 83 AEIs (52.9% of all sites reviewed received a best practice). A total of 52.5% of best practices were associated with curriculum development, delivery of effective education and assessment, and 25 available resources were identified that could be shared among AEIs. The majority of best practices (n = 117, 59.3%) were identified at 24 AEIs, with the highest number of best practices identified at Banner Simulation Center and New Orleans Learning Center (10 each over 2 reviews). Twenty-two other institutes presented 97 best practices, with between 3 to 8 per institute (mean = 4.4, standard deviation = 1.6). Specific best practices, criteria, and AEI champions are highlighted.

This study aimed to examine the evolution of the best practices observed by accreditors during site visits over the 8-year period. Methods Accreditation included the completion of an application form followed by a site visit by a simulation expert and review of all materials by an accreditation committee to identify areas out of compliance along with areas far exceeding accreditation standards. These are termed ""best practices.""To evaluate the evolution of accreditation feedback and embedded associations, the compiled list of 337 best practices identified from all 247 site visits over an 8-year period was analyzed and visualized using epistemic network analysis, a quantitative ethnographic technique for modeling the structure of connections in qualitative data. Results The overall association network of the data indicates that the strongest associations were between assessment, curriculum development, faculty development, research, and teaching methods, demonstrating a highly interconnected model of accreditation feedback. Best practices evolved from an early focus on teaching methods, faculty, and curriculum development to more advanced educational topics including assessment, research, resources, and overall center governance. Distribution of associations also increased over the 8-year period with more nuanced and interconnected statements demonstrating higher-level feedback including explanations, contributing factors, impact on other areas, and, in some cases, recommendations to share best practices outside the organization. Conclusions The epistemic network analysis of this 8-year database of simulation center feedback provides a novel perspective on an organization and the evolving field of simulation from an optional to essential modality in healthcare professions education.",10.1097/SIH.0000000000000638,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-4761-7185,23972309500.0,

Published by Cambridge University Press.Objectives: Virtual reality has emerged as a unique educational modality for medical trainees. However, incorporation of virtual reality curricula into formal training programmes has been limited. We describe a multi-centre effort to develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a virtual reality curriculum for residents participating in paediatric cardiology rotations. Methods: A virtual reality software program (The Stanford Virtual Heart) was utilised. Users are placed inside the heart and explore non-traditional views of cardiac anatomy. Modules for six common congenital heart lesions were developed, including narrative scripts. A prospective case-control study was performed involving three large paediatric residency programmes. From July 2018 to June 2019, trainees participating in an outpatient cardiology rotation completed a 27-question, validated assessment tool. From July 2019 to February 2020, trainees completed the virtual reality curriculum and assessment tool during their cardiology rotation. Qualitative feedback on the virtual reality experience was also gathered. Intervention and control group performances were compared using univariate analyses. Results: There were 80 trainees in the control group and 52 in the intervention group. Trainees in the intervention group achieved higher scores on the assessment (20.4 ± 2.9 versus 18.8 ± 3.8 out of 27 questions answered correctly, p = 0.01). Further analysis showed significant improvement in the intervention group for questions specifically testing visuospatial concepts. In total, 100% of users recommended integration of the programme into the residency curriculum. Conclusions: Virtual reality is an effective and well-received adjunct to clinical curricula for residents participating in paediatric cardiology rotations.

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,,57211189604.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Individuals with hearing loss (HL) are at higher risk for hospitalizations, and may be for readmissions, compared with their hearing peers. The objective of this prospective study was to confirm retrospective studies suggesting that HL increases hospital readmissions, and, if confirmed, possible causes for it. Methods: A prospective cohort study of English-speaking patients >55 years old admitted to general medical and surgical floors at 2 large hospital systems in southeastern Michigan over a 2-year period was conducted. All patients underwent bedside audiometric testing. HL presence and severity were categorized using World Health Organization pure tone assessment parameters. Readmission rates, Charlson comorbidity index, socio-demographic and medical variables were obtained from Epic EMR databases. Outcomes: There were 1247 hospitalized patients enrolled. Of these, 76.8% had documented HL of which 50.5% (630) was mild HL and 26.3% (328) moderate or worse HL. Patients with any HL were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic, white, male, and had less education, lower health literacy, more comorbidities, and more difficulty communicating with their doctor. Readmission rates at 30 and 90-days were similar between HL and hearing groups, after adjusting for HL severity, Charlston index, and numerous potential confounders. Conclusion: Patients with HL do not seem to have higher rates of hospital readmissions. We did find high frequency of HL in hospitalized patients along with significant communication difficulties that patients had with their clinicians.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine residency recruitment has been a requested transition to virtual interviewing by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the academic family medicine community. This has led to creative and adaptive approaches to virtual interviewing with little previous knowledge, experience, or processes. This work describes the impact of transitioning to virtual recruitment on applicants’ reported experiences and factors influencing decision-making with family medicine at a large research university. METHODS: We made a comparison of 2 years of in-person interview day surveys with 2 years of virtual interview surveys following transition to virtual recruitment. We tested differences between in-person and virtual interviews for significance using χ2 tests. RESULTS: There were significant differences in factors influencing a candi-date’s decision to apply. Candidates who participated in virtual interviews were more interested in urban training settings, a community setting, and obstetrical training compared with the in-person interview cohort. Nearly 50% of virtual candidates reported preferring virtual interviews in the future. There were no significant differences in how candidates rated their experience of the interview process and they indicated adequate contact with resident per-sonnel despite a transition to virtual interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to virtual recruitment has been well received by candidates, as indicated by the high positive ratings of the cohorts. The transition has not resulted in a negative impact on the recruitment experience or the ability to meet with resident leadership.",10.22454/fammed.2022.510274,Michigan Medicine,,57217861902.0,

It is a complex disorder with a variety of manifestations and symptom dimensions, some of which are underrecognized. Early recognition and treatment with OCD-specific therapies may improve outcomes, but there is often a delay in diagnosis. Patients can experience significant improvement with treatment, and some may achieve remission. Recommended first-line therapies are cognitive behavior therapy, specifically exposure and response prevention, and/or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Patients with OCD require higher SSRI dosages than for other indications, and the treatment response time is typically longer. When effective, long-term treatment with an SSRI is a reasonable option to prevent relapse. Patients with severe symptoms or lack of response to first-line therapies should be referred to a psychiatrist. There are a variety of options for treatment-resistant OCD, including clomipramine or augmenting an SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic. Patients with OCD should be closely monitored for psychiatric comorbidities and suicidal ideation.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7014-4729,54880169900.0,

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Academy of Pain Medicine.Evidence-based treatments for chronic low back pain (cLBP) typically work well in only a fraction of patients, and at present there is little guidance regarding what treatment should be used in which patients. Our central hypothesis is that an interventional response phenotyping study can identify individuals with different underlying mechanisms for their pain who thus respond differentially to evidence-based treatments for cLBP. Thus, we will conduct a randomized controlled Sequential, Multiple Assessment, Randomized Trial (SMART) design study in cLBP with the following three aims. Aim 1: Perform an interventional response phenotyping study in a cohort of cLBP patients (n = 400), who will receive a sequence of interventions known to be effective in cLBP. For 4 weeks, all cLBP participants will receive a web-based pain self-management program as part of a run-in period, then individuals who report no or minimal improvement will be randomized to: a) mindfulness-based stress reduction, b) physical therapy and exercise, c) acupressure self-management, and d) duloxetine. After 8 weeks, individuals who remain symptomatic will be re-randomized to a different treatment for an additional 8 weeks. Using those data, we will identify the subsets of participants that respond to each treatment. In Aim 2, we will show that currently available, clinically derived measures, can predict differential responsiveness to the treatments.

No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Background Self-reported side effects of pain medication are important determinants of treatment course that can affect patient adherence, medication discontinuation and physician decisions. Yet, few studies have investigated patient-level predictors of self-reported pain medication side effects. The present study sought to fill this gap by exploring the impact of physical or sexual abuse history on self-reported pain medication side effects and considered a mediation model in which those effects are transmitted through a centralized pain phenotype and pain catastrophizing. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 3118 patients presenting to a tertiary-care, outpatient pain clinic. Results Approximately 15% of the sample (n=479) reported a lifetime history of abuse. Patients with a lifetime history of abuse, particularly abuse that occurred in both childhood and adulthood, reported more pain medication side effects compared with patients reporting no abuse history. Furthermore, path analysis showed that a centralized pain phenotype and pain catastrophizing mediated the association between lifetime abuse history and the sum of pain medication side effects. Conclusions This suggests that individuals who experience abuse may develop a heightened physiological sensitivity to stimuli, as well as a tendency to interpret stimuli negatively, exaggerate the impact of aversive stimuli and undermine their ability to cope with the stressor. This study highlights the need for physicians to understand patient-level predictors of medication tolerance and to consider a history of abuse and trauma in decisions regarding treatment and medication management.",10.1136/rapm-2019-101130,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7417-276X,56649673000.0,15876171.0

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7417-276X,56649673000.0,

Patients and physicians often have difficulty staying abreast of diet trends, many of which focus primarily on weight loss rather than nutrition and health. Recommending an eating style can help patients make positive change. Dietary patterns that support health include the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the Healthy Eating Plate. These approaches have benefits that include prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These dietary patterns are supported by strong evidence that promotes a primary focus on unprocessed foods, fruits and vegetables, plant-based fats and proteins, legumes, whole grains, and nuts. Added sugars should be limited to less than 5% to 10% of daily caloric intake. Vegetables (not including potatoes) and fruits should make up one-half of each meal. Carbohydrate sources should primarily include beans/legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. An emphasis on monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, avocados, and nuts, and omega-3 fatty acids, such as flax, cold-water fish, and nuts, helps prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline. A focus on foods rather than macronutrients can assist patients in understanding a healthy diet.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many residency programs are developing resident wellness curricula to improve resident well-being and to meet Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education guidelines. However, there is limited guidance on preferred curricular components and implementation. We sought to identify how specific driving factors (eg, having an identified wellness champion with a budget and protected time to develop wellness programs) impact implementation of essential elements of a resident wellness curriculum. METHODS: We surveyed 608 family medicine residency program directors (PDs) in 2018-2019 on available resources for wellness programs, essential wellness elements being implemented, and satisfaction with wellness programming; 251 PDs provided complete responses (42.5% response rate). Linear and logistic regressions were conducted for main analyses. RESULTS: Having an identified wellness champion, protected time, and dedicated budget for wellness were associated with greater implementation of wellness programs and PD satisfaction with wellness programming; of these, funding had the strongest association. Larger programs were implementing more wellness program components. Program setting had no association with implementation. CONCLUSIONS: PDs in programs allocating money and/or faculty time can expect more wellness programming and greater satisfaction with how resident well-being is addressed.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.317857,Cornelius,0000-0001-7417-276X,56649673000.0,

All rights reserved.Background: COVID-19 has transformed the landscape of telemedicine utilization, shifting from predominantly in-person services to increased virtual encounters. Although telemedicine offers increased accessibility for medical care, many advocates voice concern about utilization and satisfaction with these services among individuals who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) given the unique practical, mental, and physical health challenges many face. Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate differences in telemedicine utilization and satisfaction, as well as global health and perceived loneliness, among data-driven patterns of IPV during the early phases of the pandemic. Methods: In this longitudinal survey study, participants first completed an online survey between May 2019 and February 2020 that assessed social, psychological, and physical functioning, as well as emotional and physical IPV. A follow-up survey sent in May 2020 assessed recent telemedicine use and satisfaction, as well as response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Latent class analysis favored 4 classes of IPV that differed based on severity and features of IPV experienced. Although all 4 classes reported high satisfaction with telemedicine, individuals reporting low IPV had the highest satisfaction with telemedicine and the lowest rates of telemedicine utilization. Individuals who experienced IPV, particularly multiple forms of emotional and physical IPV, reported high physical and social concerns and perceived stress. Conclusions: Clinicians using telemedicine should be aware of the multiple challenges faced by individuals experiencing IPV and take additional steps to ensure their needs are met in a safe way.

The plan, however, does not offer a recommendation as to which elements may be most important, least resource intensive, or most feasible. This study sought to identify the most essential components of the AFMRD’s Well-Being Action Plan, as rated by expert panelists using a modified Delphi technique. METHODS: Sixty-eight selected experts were asked to participate; after three rounds of surveys, the final sample included 27 participants (7% residents, 38% MD faculty, 54% behavioral science faculty). RESULTS: Fourteen elements were rated as essential by at least 80% of the participants. These components included interventions at both the system and individual level. Of those elements ranked in the top five by a majority of the panel, all but one do not mention specific curricular content, but rather discusses the nature of a wellness curriculum.

A subset of these patients may be engaging in therapies that have little or no evidence for efficacy and carry significant potential risks to their health. These therapies, however, may carry a great deal of significance for the patient and family for whom conventional medicine has failed or is otherwise deemed untenable. Dismissing such therapies as “quackery” risks alienating patients and damaging or even severing a therapeutic relationship. When faced with patients who are engaging in potentially unsafe low-evidence therapies (PULETs), clinicians themselves may experience a great deal of moral distress when deciding how to balance supporting the hope PULETs may represent with the principles of nonmaleficence and autonomy. In this article, we will review the definition of PULETs and distinguish them from most CAM therapies. Drawing upon existing writings in the CAM literature, we will then review a framework to evaluate the relative risk/benefit ratio of such therapies followed by a review of the ethical and legal aspects of care.

Patients (n = 1,542) presenting to a tertiary-care, outpatient pain clinic completed a cross-sectional survey consisting of regularly collected clinical data and validated measures. Path analysis suggested that the impact of childhood abuse on sensory and affective pain-related characteristics was partially explained by perceived emotional support. Survivors of childhood abuse display a more complex clinical pain phenotype and this extends to more negative perceptions of social support.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Residency program directors (PDs) are tasked with supporting resident well-being, and a 2018-2019 CERA survey found PDs to be generally satisfied with residency wellness curricula. However, less is known about graduate medical education wellness programming following the unprecedented social and public health stressors of 2020. This study aimed to evaluate PDs’ satisfaction with wellness programming and perceived changes in wellness program implementation in the context of these factors. METHODS: An online survey was administered by CERA to the program directors of all ACGME-accredited, US-based family medicine residencies. The survey replicated a 2018 CERA survey and assessed PDs’ satisfaction with the wellness curriculum and which wellness curricular elements were currently implemented in the residency. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 263 PDs (42% response rate). There was no difference in total number of wellness curricular elements reported in programs in 2021(M=9.85) vs 2018 (M=9.57; P=.377). Compared to the 2018 survey, PDs reported increased assessment of resident burnout (P=.02), increased scheduled time for personal needs (P=.002), but decreased scheduled time for interpersonal connection (P=.017). Most PDs reported increased emphasis on wellness and the same or increased access to wellness resources compared to 2018 χ2 indicated no significant difference in PD satisfaction with wellness programming between the two years (P=.84). CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant social and public health challenges to curriculum delivery, family medicine PDs did not perceive significant reductions in wellness programming, and in fact reported increases in some specific curricular elements and an overall increased emphasis on well-being.

The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) includes disordered gut motility, alterations in gut microbiota, neural-hormonal system abnormalities, immune reactivity, and visceral hypersensitivity. Timely diagnosis of IBS-D can be achieved easily using clinical criteria. Formal IBS diagnosis is important for optimizing treatment and patient outcomes and facilitating patient access to appropriate educational resources. Yet, given the symptom overlap with other gastrointestinal conditions, diagnosis of IBS-D often is perceived to be challenging. Treatment of IBS includes both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options. Rifaximin, alosetron, and eluxadoline are effective treatments indicated for IBS-D, but have limited availability internationally. Dietary approaches may also be indicated for certain patients with IBS-D. Psychological interventions may be effective in treating abdominal pain alone and global symptoms in IBS. We describe use of these diverse therapies and provide an overview to facilitate the primary care provider’s approach to distinguishing IBS-D from other conditions with symptom overlap.",10.1007/s12325-022-02224-z,Division of Hepatology,,6602363764.0,5304426.0

To date, no inventory exists of the advanced procedures and clinical skills performed by teaching family physicians. This study comprises the first such survey and assesses the attitude of respondents toward the importance of family physicians performing procedures. Methods: We sent a clinical skills inventory to a convenience sample of teaching family physicians employed at 18 medical school-affiliated, community, and military residency programs across the United States. Results: The overall response rate was 46% (N=337). Respondents performed a median of 12 advanced procedures and clinical skills (IQR: 8-18). Endorsed procedures ranged from skin biopsy (n=316, 93.8%) and joint injection (n=279, 82.8%) to colonoscopy (n=21, 6.2%) and cesarean delivery (n=23, 6.8%), and reported skills ranged from medication-assisted treatment (n=181, 53.7%) to highly active antiretrovial therapy (n=35, 10.4%). Gender and career stage were associated with statistically significant differences in endorsement of specific procedures. For example, fracture management was more likely to be performed by late-versus early-career faculty (54.1% vs 24.2%, P<.001) and by male versus female respondents (54.9% vs 24.2%, P<.001). Most respondents (84.3%) agreed that future family physicians should learn procedures and advanced clinical skills. Conclusions: Family medicine teaching faculty perform a wide array of procedures and advanced skills. Apparent differences by career stage and gender identity in the performance of some of the procedural and skill areas may portend a shift in the procedural training of future family physicians.",10.22454/FamMed.2024.197714,University of Minnesota Medical School,,6602363764.0,

Most program directors reported that less than 50% of residents will leave their programs with the ability to detect an error in original research (23.8%; 67/281), detect an important omission in an UpToDate article (16%; 45/281), or author a narrative review for American Family Physician (10%; 28/281). Conclusions: Program directors reported strong acceptance of EBM among residents and a high prevalence of a formal curriculum. However, many lacked a specific faculty lead, and few reported that residents had strong EBM skills. This study identified gaps in residency training to support future EBM-skilled family physicians as well as concerns about pathways for the development of future EBM faculty.",10.22454/FamMed.2024.895739,Rush University,,6602363764.0,

Methods: As part of a large annual survey of family medicine clerkship directors (FMCDs), 10 questions were disseminated in May 2023 about perceived levels of imprecise assessments by faculty. We aimed to determine to what extent respondents felt their institution’s evaluation system propagated inaccurate grading. Results: A total of 52% of 169 FMCDs responded to the survey. Of these, 7% of respondents were completely confident that their preceptors would give two students of identical competence the same clinical evaluation rating. FMCDs estimated that an average of 38% of their preceptors inaccurately rate student performance. Most clerkships use an Honors/High Pass/Pass/Fail grading system. We found that 51% of FMCDs prefer to use a different grading paradigm than they currently use. We asked FMCDs to estimate the percentage of students that expressed concern over inaccurate preceptor ratings. Grading systems with more tiers were associated with a higher percentage of concerned students. Conclusions: Clerkship grades are widely used by residency program directors to classify and differentiate student applicants. We identified a significant concern from FMCDs that clinical evaluation ratings can vary greatly. Given the high stakes and perceived inaccuracy of clerkship grading, we recommend continued investigation into the appropriate weighing and usage of clinical evaluations. Continued exploration is recommended to develop grading paradigms centered on criterion-based assessment.",10.22454/FamMed.2024.819598,Baylor College of Medicine,,6602363764.0,

Neurogastroenterology & Motility published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: The knowledge and proficiency of primary care practitioners (PCPs) in diagnosing and managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remain generally low and variable internationally. This variability is partly due to a lack of familiarity with the Rome Foundation diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for this condition. Methods: We conducted an electronic survey of PCPs in the United States and nine European countries to assess their understanding of IBS pathophysiology; the use of Rome IV criteria in diagnosis, knowledge of and frequency in prescribing various recommended treatments; and the likelihood of referring patients with suspected IBS to subspecialists. Results: Most PCPs in the United States and Europe perceive IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion rather than a definitive diagnosis. They also believe IBS is underdiagnosed in primary care and challenging to diagnose confidently. The majority of PCPs consider diet as a crucial component of IBS management. Notably, US PCPs reported greater confidence than their European counterparts in recommending dietary interventions such as increased dietary fiber, a low FODMAP diet, and gluten restriction. Conversely, both groups exhibited moderate to high confidence in recommending over-the-counter treatments. European PCPs showed greater confidence in treating IBS with antispasmodics and secretagogues, while US PCPs expressed greater confidence in prescribing neuromodulators. Additionally, US PCPs were more likely to refer patients with suspected IBS to a gastroenterologist, whereas both US and European PCPs showed similar referral patterns to dietitians and referred very few patients to mental health providers. Both US and European PCPs reported that IBS is moderately to extremely difficult to treat effectively and emphasized the importance of a strong and longitudinal doctor-patient relationship in managing the condition. Conclusion: Despite the Rome Foundation recommendations and criteria to support a positive diagnosis of IBS, most PCPs still rely on exclusionary investigations such as endoscopy and a serologic workup, while a significant percentage suggest referring patients to gastroenterologists.",10.1111/nmo.14967,University of Michigan Medical School,,6602363764.0,

Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,6602363764.0,

John D Creswell,Going virtual: mixed methods evaluation of online versus in-person learning in the NIH mixed methods research training program retreat,2024.0,BMC Medical Education,Article,Mixed methods research; Online education; Research capacity building; Research training; Teaching methods,"The Author(s) 2024.Background: Despite the central role of mixed methods in health research, studies evaluating online methods training in the health sciences are nonexistent. The focused goal was to evaluate online training by comparing the self-rated skills of scholars who experienced an in-person retreat to scholars in an online retreat in specific domains of mixed methods research for the health sciences from 2015–2023. Methods: The authors administered a scholar Mixed Methods Skills Self-Assessment instrument based on an educational competency scale that included domains on: “research questions,” “design/approach,” “sampling,” “analysis,” and “dissemination” to participants of the Mixed Methods Research Training Program for the Health Sciences (MMRTP). Self-ratings on confidence on domains were compared before and after retreat participation within cohorts who attended in person (n = 73) or online (n = 57) as well as comparing across in-person to online cohorts. Responses to open-ended questions about experiences with the retreat were analyzed. Results: Scholars in an interactive program to improve mixed methods skills reported significantly increased confidence in ability to define or explain concepts and in ability to apply the concepts to practical problems, whether the program was attended in-person or synchronously online. Scholars in the online retreat had self-rated skill improvements as good or better than scholars who participated in person. With the possible exception of networking, scholars found the online format was associated with advantages such as accessibility and reduced burden of travel and finding childcare. No differences in difficulty of learning concepts was described. Conclusions: Keeping in mind that the retreat is only one component of the MMRTP, this study provides evidence that mixed methods training online was associated with the same increases in self-rated skills as persons attending online and can be a key component to increasing the capacity for mixed methods research in the health sciences.",10.1186/s12909-024-05877-2,Johns Hopkins University,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

John D Creswell,Generating metainferences in mixed methods research: A worked example in convergent mixed methods designs,2023.0,Methodological Innovations,Article,data analysis; inferences; metainferences; Mixed methods; mixed methods research,"The Author(s) 2023.Metainferences, or the insights derived from integrating quantitative and qualitative inferences at the end of a study, are crucial for achieving added value and synergy in mixed methods research. There is an ongoing need to understand how researchers generate metainferences, especially considering their pivotal role in helping researchers achieve full quantitative and qualitative integration. While some examples of metainferences generation are available in the mixed methods literature, more explicit guidance is required. Approaches to developing metainferences must also be contextual, as inferences of this type are contingent on the nature and purpose of the mixed methods study, the type of mixed methods design, and the quality of the research data. This paper describes a seven-step process for generating metainferences using a convergent mixed methods study as an exemplar. These steps consist of identifying knowledge, experience, and data-driven inferences from the quantitative and qualitative data; developing inference association maps to draw metainferences; and assessing the validity of metainferences using backward working heuristics. This paper contributes to mixed methods research by shedding light on the development of metainferences in convergent designs and by providing practical and tangible tools for making sense of the complexity of the analysis and interpretation tasks involved in the process of generating metainferences.",10.1177/20597991231188121,Memorial University of Newfoundland,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

We conducted a pilot trial of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to deliver a home-based intervention “for refugees by refugees” to improve family functioning and child mental health. N = 80 refugee families in the Greater Boston area participated in the study (n = 40 Somali Bantu families; n = 40 Bhutanese families) with n = 41 families randomized to care-as-usual. Of the 39 families who received FSI-R, n = 36 caregivers and children completed qualitative exit interviews. We present findings from these interviews to identify the mechanisms through which a family-strengthening intervention for refugees can be acceptable, feasible, and effective at improving family functioning and children's mental health outcomes. Authors applied Grounded Theory to code interview transcripts and detailed field notes and used an iterative process to arrive at final codes, themes, and a theoretical framework. The greatest contributors to acceptability and feasibility included flexibility in scheduling intervention sessions, the interventionist being a community member, and improvements to family communication and time spent together. All of these factors were made possible by the CBPR approach. Our findings suggest that given the socio-political context within the U.S. and the economic challenges faced by refugee families, the successful implementation of such interventions hinges on culturally-grounding the intervention design process, drawing heavily on community input, and prioritizing community members as interventionists.",10.1177/13634615221111627,Brown University,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

The complete bibliographic information, a link to the original publication on https://www.researchprotocols.org, as well as this copyright and license information must be included.Background: Communication is a critical component of the patient-provider relationship; however, limited research exists on the role of nonverbal communication. Virtual human training is an informatics-based educational strategy that offers various benefits in communication skill training directed at providers. Recent informatics-based interventions aimed at improving communication have mainly focused on verbal communication, yet research is needed to better understand how virtual humans can improve verbal and nonverbal communication and further elucidate the patient-provider dyad. Objective: The purpose of this study is to enhance a conceptual model that incorporates technology to examine verbal and nonverbal components of communication and develop a nonverbal assessment that will be included in the virtual simulation for further testing. Methods: This study will consist of a multistage mixed methods design, including convergent and exploratory sequential components. A convergent mixed methods study will be conducted to examine the mediating effects of nonverbal communication. Quantitative (eg, MPathic game scores, Kinect nonverbal data, objective structured clinical examination communication score, and Roter Interaction Analysis System and Facial Action Coding System coding of video) and qualitative data (eg, video recordings of MPathic-virtual reality [VR] interventions and student reflections) will be collected simultaneously. Data will be merged to determine the most crucial components of nonverbal behavior in human-computer interaction. An exploratory sequential design will proceed, consisting of a grounded theory qualitative phase. Using theoretical, purposeful sampling, interviews will be conducted with oncology providers probing intentional nonverbal behaviors. The qualitative findings will aid the development of a nonverbal communication model that will be included in a virtual human. The subsequent quantitative strand will incorporate and validate a new automated nonverbal communication behavior assessment into the virtual human simulation, MPathic-VR, by assessing interrater reliability, code interactions, and dyadic data analysis by comparing Kinect responses (system recorded) to manually scored records for specific nonverbal behaviors. Data will be integrated using building integration to develop the automated nonverbal communication behavior assessment and conduct a quality check of these nonverbal features. Results: Secondary data from the MPathic-VR randomized controlled trial data set (210 medical students and 840 video recordings of interactions) were analyzed in the first part of this study. Results showed differential experiences by performance in the intervention group. Following the analysis of the convergent design, participants consisting of medical providers (n=30) will be recruited for the qualitative phase of the subsequent exploratory sequential design. We plan to complete data collection by July 2023 to analyze and integrate these findings. Conclusions: The results from this study contribute to the improvement of patient-provider communication, both verbal and nonverbal, including the dissemination of health information and health outcomes for patients. Further, this research aims to transfer to various topical areas, including medication safety, informed consent processes, patient instructions, and treatment adherence between patients and providers.",10.2196/46601,University of Nebraska–Lincoln,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

John D Creswell,Family-Based Mental Health Promotion for Somali Bantu and Bhutanese Refugees: Feasibility and Acceptability Trial,2020.0,Journal of Adolescent Health,Article,Family functioning; Intervention; Prevention; Refugees; Youth mental health,"2019Purpose: There are disparities in mental health of refugee youth compared with the general U.S. population. We conducted a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial of the home-visiting Family Strengthening Intervention for refugees (FSI-R) using a community-based participatory research approach. The FSI-R aims to promote youth mental health and family relationships. We hypothesized that FSI-R families would have better psychosocial outcomes and family functioning postintervention compared with care-as-usual (CAU) families. We hypothesized that FSI-R would be feasible to implement and accepted by communities. Methods: A total of 40 Somali Bantu (n = 103 children, 58.40% female; n = 43 caregivers, 79.00% female) and 40 Bhutanese (n = 49 children, 55.30% female; n = 62 caregivers, 54.00% female) families were randomized to receive FSI-R or CAU. Refugee research assistants conducted psychosocial assessments pre- and post-intervention, and home visitors delivered the preventive intervention. Multilevel modeling assessed the effects of FSI-R. Feasibility was measured from retention, and acceptability was measured from satisfaction surveys. Results: The retention rate of 82.50% indicates high feasibility, and high reports of satisfaction (81.50%) indicate community acceptance. Across communities, FSI-R children reported reduced traumatic stress reactions, and caregivers reported fewer child depression symptoms compared with CAU families (β = −.42; p = .03; β = −.34; p = .001). Bhutanese FSI-R children reported reduced family arguing (β = −1.32; p = .04) and showed fewer depression symptoms and conduct problems by parent report (β = −9.20; p = .04; β = −.92; p = .01) compared with CAU. There were no significant differences by group on other measures. Conclusions: A family-based home-visiting preventive intervention can be feasible and acceptable and has promise for promoting mental health and family functioning among refugees.",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.08.023,Boston College,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

This prospective, mixed-methods study had two components, one for staff and one for patients. Staff fidelity to MI principles was graded through audio-recorded encounters after initial and final training sessions. After training, patients graded staff for adherence to autonomy supportive care. Semi-structured interviews with para-professionals elicited feedback about the training and about their ability to implement MI in the clinic. The impact on patient satisfaction with staff communication, eye drop instillation self-efficacy, and overall health activation was assessed using a survey pre- and post-training. Para-professionals met two of three program goals for MI skills and improved in their overall scores for MI fidelity. Para-professionals noted lack of time in the clinic as a significant barrier to implementing counseling. Patient satisfaction with staff communication increased after the training (p = 0.04) among patients who rated their staff above the mean for providing autonomy supportive care. The intervention did not improve patients’ eye drop instillation self-efficacy or overall health activation. Training para-professional staff in brief, glaucoma-specific MI techniques is feasible and may improve patient satisfaction, though dedicated time in clinic is needed to implement MI counseling into glaucoma practice.",10.1080/10410236.2018.1557357,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Our aim was to understand how reviewers appraise mixed methods research by analyzing reviewer comments for grant applications submitted primarily to the National Institutes of Health. We requested scholars and consultants in the Mixed Methods Research Training Program (MMRTP) for the Health Sciences to send us summary statements from their mixed methods grant applications and obtained 40 summary statements of funded (40%) and unfunded (60%) mixed methods grant applications. We conducted a document analysis using a coding rubric based on the NIH Best Practices for Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences and allowed inductive codes to emerge. Reviewers favorably appraised mixed methods applications demonstrating coherence among aims and research design elements, detailed methods, plans for mixed methods integration, and the use of theoretical models. Reviewers identified weaknesses in mixed methods applications that lacked methodological details or rationales, had a high participant burden, and failed to delineate investigator roles. Successful mixed methods applications convey assumptions behind the methods chosen to accomplish specific aims and clearly detail the procedures to be taken.

All rights reserved.Health disparity populations are socially disadvantaged, and the multiple levels of discrimination they often experience mean that their characteristics and attributes differ from those of the mainstream. Programs and policies targeted at reducing health disparities or improving minority health must consider these differences. Despite the importance of evaluating health disparities research to produce high-quality data that can guide decision-making, it is not yet a customary practice. Although health disparities evaluations incorporate the same scientific methods as all evaluations, they have unique components such as population characteristics, sociocultural context, and the lack of health disparity common indicators and metrics that must be considered in every phase of the research. This article describes evaluation strategies grouped into 3 components: formative (needs assessments and process), design and methodology (multilevel designs used in real-world settings), and summative (outcomes, impacts, and cost). Each section will describe the standards for each component, discuss the unique health disparity aspects, and provide strategies from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Metrics and Measures Visioning Workshop (April 2016) to advance the evaluation of health disparities research.",10.2105/AJPH.2018.304808,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR),0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

All rights reserved.Understanding health disparity causes is an important first step toward developing policies or interventions to eliminate disparities, but their nature makes identifying and addressing their causes challenging. Potential causal factors are often correlated, making it difficult to distinguish their effects. These factors may exist at different organizational levels (e.g., individual, family, neighborhood), each of which needs to be appropriately conceptualized and measured. The processes that generate health disparities may include complex relationships with feedback loops and dynamic properties that traditional statistical models represent poorly. Because of this complexity, identifying disparities’ causes and remedies requires integrating findings from multiple methodologies. We highlight analytic methods and designs, multilevel approaches, complex systems modeling techniques, and qualitative methods that should be more broadly employed and adapted to advance health disparities research and identify approaches to mitigate them.",10.2105/AJPH.2018.304843,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

Although evidence based guidelines for contraceptive selection in the presence of medical conditions are available via the United States Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC), these guidelines are underutilized. Research also supports the use of decision tools to promote shared decision making between patients and providers during contraceptive counseling. Objective: The overall goal of the MiHealth, MiChoice project is to design and implement a theory-driven, Web-based tool that incorporates the US MEC (provider-level intervention) within the vehicle of a contraceptive decision tool for women with chronic medical conditions (patient-level intervention) in community-based primary care settings (practice-level intervention). This will be a 3-phase study that includes a predesign phase, a design phase, and a testing phase in a randomized controlled trial. This study protocol describes phase 1 and aim 1, which is to determine patient-, provider-, and practice-level factors that are relevant to the design and implementation of the contraceptive decision tool. Methods: This is a mixed methods implementation study. To customize the delivery of the US MEC in the decision tool, we selected high-priority constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Theoretical Domains Framework to drive data collection and analysis at the practice and provider level, respectively. A conceptual model that incorporates constructs from the transtheoretical model and the health beliefs model undergirds patient-level data collection and analysis and will inform customization of the decision tool for this population. We will recruit 6 community-based primary care practices and conduct quantitative surveys and semistructured qualitative interviews with women who have chronic medical conditions, their primary care providers (PCPs), and clinic staff, as well as field observations of practice activities. Quantitative survey data will be summarized with simple descriptive statistics and relationships between participant characteristics and contraceptive recommendations (for PCPs), and current contraceptive use (for patients) will be examined using Fisher exact test. We will conduct thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and field observations. The integration of data will occur by comparing, contrasting, and synthesizing qualitative and quantitative findings to inform the future development and implementation of the intervention. Results: We are currently enrolling practices and anticipate study completion in 15 months. Conclusions: This protocol describes the first phase of a multiphase mixed methods study to develop and implement a Web-based decision tool that is customized to meet the needs of women with chronic medical conditions in primary care settings. Study findings will promote contraceptive counseling via shared decision making and reflect evidence-based guidelines for contraceptive selection.",10.2196/resprot.9249,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4646-8410,7004007865.0,

We describe the development of a self-rated mixed methods skills assessment and provide validity evidence. The instrument taps six research domains: “Research question,” “Design/approach,” “Sampling,” “Data collection,” “Analysis,” and “Dissemination.” Respondents are asked to rate their ability to define or explain concepts of mixed methods under each domain, their ability to apply the concepts to problems, and the extent to which they need to improve. Methods: We administered the questionnaire to 145 faculty and students using an internet survey. We analyzed descriptive statistics and performance characteristics of the questionnaire using the Cronbach alpha to assess reliability and an analysis of variance that compared a mixed methods experience index with assessment scores to assess criterion relatedness. Results: Internal consistency reliability was high for the total set of items (0.95) and adequate (≥0.71) for all but one subscale. Consistent with establishing criterion validity, respondents who had more professional experiences with mixed methods (eg, published a mixed methods article) rated themselves as more skilled, which was statistically significant across the research domains. Discussion: This self-rated mixed methods assessment instrument may be a useful tool to assess skills in mixed methods for training programs. It can be applied widely at the graduate and faculty level. For the learner, assessment may lead to enhanced motivation to learn and training focused on self-identified needs. For faculty, the assessment may improve curriculum and course content planning.",10.1097/CEH.0000000000000152,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,7004007865.0,

This prospective, mixed-methods study had two components, one for staff and one for patients. Staff fidelity to MI principles was graded through audio-recorded encounters after initial and final training sessions. After training, patients graded staff for adherence to autonomy supportive care. Semi-structured interviews with para-professionals elicited feedback about the training and about their ability to implement MI in the clinic. The impact on patient satisfaction with staff communication, eye drop instillation self-efficacy, and overall health activation was assessed using a survey pre- and post-training. Para-professionals met two of three program goals for MI skills and improved in their overall scores for MI fidelity. Para-professionals noted lack of time in the clinic as a significant barrier to implementing counseling. Patient satisfaction with staff communication increased after the training (p = 0.04) among patients who rated their staff above the mean for providing autonomy supportive care. The intervention did not improve patients’ eye drop instillation self-efficacy or overall health activation.

Virtual human training is an informatics-based educational strategy that offers various benefits in communication skill training directed at providers. Recent informatics-based interventions aimed at improving communication have mainly focused on verbal communication, yet research is needed to better understand how virtual humans can improve verbal and nonverbal communication and further elucidate the patient-provider dyad. Objective: The purpose of this study is to enhance a conceptual model that incorporates technology to examine verbal and nonverbal components of communication and develop a nonverbal assessment that will be included in the virtual simulation for further testing. Methods: This study will consist of a multistage mixed methods design, including convergent and exploratory sequential components. A convergent mixed methods study will be conducted to examine the mediating effects of nonverbal communication. Quantitative (eg, MPathic game scores, Kinect nonverbal data, objective structured clinical examination communication score, and Roter Interaction Analysis System and Facial Action Coding System coding of video) and qualitative data (eg, video recordings of MPathic-virtual reality [VR] interventions and student reflections) will be collected simultaneously. Data will be merged to determine the most crucial components of nonverbal behavior in human-computer interaction. An exploratory sequential design will proceed, consisting of a grounded theory qualitative phase. Using theoretical, purposeful sampling, interviews will be conducted with oncology providers probing intentional nonverbal behaviors. The qualitative findings will aid the development of a nonverbal communication model that will be included in a virtual human. The subsequent quantitative strand will incorporate and validate a new automated nonverbal communication behavior assessment into the virtual human simulation, MPathic-VR, by assessing interrater reliability, code interactions, and dyadic data analysis by comparing Kinect responses (system recorded) to manually scored records for specific nonverbal behaviors. Data will be integrated using building integration to develop the automated nonverbal communication behavior assessment and conduct a quality check of these nonverbal features. Results: Secondary data from the MPathic-VR randomized controlled trial data set (210 medical students and 840 video recordings of interactions) were analyzed in the first part of this study. Results showed differential experiences by performance in the intervention group. Following the analysis of the convergent design, participants consisting of medical providers (n=30) will be recruited for the qualitative phase of the subsequent exploratory sequential design. We plan to complete data collection by July 2023 to analyze and integrate these findings. Conclusions: The results from this study contribute to the improvement of patient-provider communication, both verbal and nonverbal, including the dissemination of health information and health outcomes for patients. Further, this research aims to transfer to various topical areas, including medication safety, informed consent processes, patient instructions, and treatment adherence between patients and providers.",10.2196/46601,University of Nebraska–Lincoln,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,7948561.0

We conducted a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial of the home-visiting Family Strengthening Intervention for refugees (FSI-R) using a community-based participatory research approach. The FSI-R aims to promote youth mental health and family relationships. We hypothesized that FSI-R families would have better psychosocial outcomes and family functioning postintervention compared with care-as-usual (CAU) families. We hypothesized that FSI-R would be feasible to implement and accepted by communities. Methods: A total of 40 Somali Bantu (n = 103 children, 58.40% female; n = 43 caregivers, 79.00% female) and 40 Bhutanese (n = 49 children, 55.30% female; n = 62 caregivers, 54.00% female) families were randomized to receive FSI-R or CAU. Refugee research assistants conducted psychosocial assessments pre- and post-intervention, and home visitors delivered the preventive intervention. Multilevel modeling assessed the effects of FSI-R. Feasibility was measured from retention, and acceptability was measured from satisfaction surveys. Results: The retention rate of 82.50% indicates high feasibility, and high reports of satisfaction (81.50%) indicate community acceptance. Across communities, FSI-R children reported reduced traumatic stress reactions, and caregivers reported fewer child depression symptoms compared with CAU families (β = −.42; p = .03; β = −.34; p = .001). Bhutanese FSI-R children reported reduced family arguing (β = −1.32; p = .04) and showed fewer depression symptoms and conduct problems by parent report (β = −9.20; p = .04; β = −.92; p = .01) compared with CAU. There were no significant differences by group on other measures. Conclusions: A family-based home-visiting preventive intervention can be feasible and acceptable and has promise for promoting mental health and family functioning among refugees.",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.08.023,Boston College,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

There is an ongoing need to understand how researchers generate metainferences, especially considering their pivotal role in helping researchers achieve full quantitative and qualitative integration. While some examples of metainferences generation are available in the mixed methods literature, more explicit guidance is required. Approaches to developing metainferences must also be contextual, as inferences of this type are contingent on the nature and purpose of the mixed methods study, the type of mixed methods design, and the quality of the research data. This paper describes a seven-step process for generating metainferences using a convergent mixed methods study as an exemplar. These steps consist of identifying knowledge, experience, and data-driven inferences from the quantitative and qualitative data; developing inference association maps to draw metainferences; and assessing the validity of metainferences using backward working heuristics. This paper contributes to mixed methods research by shedding light on the development of metainferences in convergent designs and by providing practical and tangible tools for making sense of the complexity of the analysis and interpretation tasks involved in the process of generating metainferences.",10.1177/20597991231188121,Memorial University of Newfoundland,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

The focused goal was to evaluate online training by comparing the self-rated skills of scholars who experienced an in-person retreat to scholars in an online retreat in specific domains of mixed methods research for the health sciences from 2015–2023. Methods: The authors administered a scholar Mixed Methods Skills Self-Assessment instrument based on an educational competency scale that included domains on: “research questions,” “design/approach,” “sampling,” “analysis,” and “dissemination” to participants of the Mixed Methods Research Training Program for the Health Sciences (MMRTP). Self-ratings on confidence on domains were compared before and after retreat participation within cohorts who attended in person (n = 73) or online (n = 57) as well as comparing across in-person to online cohorts. Responses to open-ended questions about experiences with the retreat were analyzed. Results: Scholars in an interactive program to improve mixed methods skills reported significantly increased confidence in ability to define or explain concepts and in ability to apply the concepts to practical problems, whether the program was attended in-person or synchronously online. Scholars in the online retreat had self-rated skill improvements as good or better than scholars who participated in person. With the possible exception of networking, scholars found the online format was associated with advantages such as accessibility and reduced burden of travel and finding childcare. No differences in difficulty of learning concepts was described. Conclusions: Keeping in mind that the retreat is only one component of the MMRTP, this study provides evidence that mixed methods training online was associated with the same increases in self-rated skills as persons attending online and can be a key component to increasing the capacity for mixed methods research in the health sciences.",10.1186/s12909-024-05877-2,Johns Hopkins University,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,7948561.0

These standards describe what should be included in a research report to enable and facilitate the review process. This publication marks a historical moment-the first inclusion of qualitative research in APA Style, which is the basis of both the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2010) and APA Style CENTRAL, an online program to support APA Style. In addition to the general JARS-Qual guidelines, the Working Group has developed standards for both qualitative meta-analysis and mixed methods research. The reporting standards were developed for psychological qualitative research but may hold utility for a broad range of social sciences. They honor a range of qualitative traditions, methods, and reporting styles. The Working Group was composed of a group of researchers with backgrounds in varying methods, research topics, and approaches to inquiry. In this article, they present these standards and their rationale, and they detail the ways that the standards differ from the quantitative research reporting standards.

All rights reserved.Understanding health disparity causes is an important first step toward developing policies or interventions to eliminate disparities, but their nature makes identifying and addressing their causes challenging. Potential causal factors are often correlated, making it difficult to distinguish their effects. These factors may exist at different organizational levels (e.g., individual, family, neighborhood), each of which needs to be appropriately conceptualized and measured. The processes that generate health disparities may include complex relationships with feedback loops and dynamic properties that traditional statistical models represent poorly. Because of this complexity, identifying disparities’ causes and remedies requires integrating findings from multiple methodologies. We highlight analytic methods and designs, multilevel approaches, complex systems modeling techniques, and qualitative methods that should be more broadly employed and adapted to advance health disparities research and identify approaches to mitigate them.",10.2105/AJPH.2018.304843,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

All rights reserved.Health disparity populations are socially disadvantaged, and the multiple levels of discrimination they often experience mean that their characteristics and attributes differ from those of the mainstream. Programs and policies targeted at reducing health disparities or improving minority health must consider these differences. Despite the importance of evaluating health disparities research to produce high-quality data that can guide decision-making, it is not yet a customary practice. Although health disparities evaluations incorporate the same scientific methods as all evaluations, they have unique components such as population characteristics, sociocultural context, and the lack of health disparity common indicators and metrics that must be considered in every phase of the research. This article describes evaluation strategies grouped into 3 components: formative (needs assessments and process), design and methodology (multilevel designs used in real-world settings), and summative (outcomes, impacts, and cost). Each section will describe the standards for each component, discuss the unique health disparity aspects, and provide strategies from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Metrics and Measures Visioning Workshop (April 2016) to advance the evaluation of health disparities research.",10.2105/AJPH.2018.304808,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR),0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

We conducted a pilot trial of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to deliver a home-based intervention “for refugees by refugees” to improve family functioning and child mental health. N = 80 refugee families in the Greater Boston area participated in the study (n = 40 Somali Bantu families; n = 40 Bhutanese families) with n = 41 families randomized to care-as-usual. Of the 39 families who received FSI-R, n = 36 caregivers and children completed qualitative exit interviews. We present findings from these interviews to identify the mechanisms through which a family-strengthening intervention for refugees can be acceptable, feasible, and effective at improving family functioning and children's mental health outcomes. Authors applied Grounded Theory to code interview transcripts and detailed field notes and used an iterative process to arrive at final codes, themes, and a theoretical framework. The greatest contributors to acceptability and feasibility included flexibility in scheduling intervention sessions, the interventionist being a community member, and improvements to family communication and time spent together. All of these factors were made possible by the CBPR approach.

All rights reserved.Importance: Evidence-based weight management treatments (WMTs) are underused; strategies are needed to increase WMT use and patients' weight loss. Objective: To evaluate the association of a primary care-based weight navigation program (WNP) with WMT use and weight loss. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study comprised a retrospective evaluation of a quality improvement program conducted from October 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. Data analysis was performed from August 2, 2022, to March 7, 2024. Adults with obesity and 1 or more weight-related condition from intervention and control sites in a large academic health system in the Midwestern US were propensity matched on sociodemographic and clinical factors. Exposure: WNP, in which American Board of Obesity Medicine-certified primary care physicians offered weight-focused visits and guided patients' selection of preference-sensitive WMTs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were feasibility measures, including rates of referral to and engagement in the WNP. Secondary outcomes were mean weight loss, percentage of patients achieving 5% or more and 10% or more weight loss, referral to WMTs, and number of antiobesity medication prescriptions at 12 months. Results: Of 264 patients, 181 (68.6%) were female and mean (SD) age was 49.5 (13.0) years; there were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between WNP patients (n = 132) and matched controls (n = 132). Of 1159 WNP-eligible patients, 219 (18.9%) were referred to the WNP and 132 (11.4%) completed a visit. In a difference-in-differences analysis, WNP patients lost 4.9 kg more than matched controls (95% CI, 2.11-7.76; P <.001), had 4.4% greater weight loss (95% CI, 2.2%-6.4%; P <.001), and were more likely to achieve 5% or more weight loss (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% CI, 1.54-5.58); average marginal effects, 21.2%; 95% CI, 8.8%-33.6%) and 10% or more weight loss (OR, 7.19; 95% CI, 2.55-25.9; average marginal effects, 17.4%; 95% CI, 8.7%-26.2%). Patients in the WNP group were referred at higher rates to WMTs, including bariatric surgery (18.9% vs 9.1%; P =.02), a low-calorie meal replacement program (16.7% vs 3.8%; P <.001), and a Mediterranean-style diet and activity program (10.6% vs 1.5%; P =.002). There were no between-group differences in antiobesity medication prescribing.

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65.

Clinical Obesity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of World Obesity Federation.Obesity is the most common chronic condition in the United States (US), yet primary care physicians face barriers in providing obesity treatment. This study examines the prevalence of American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) certified obesity specialists on the faculty of US Family Medicine residency training programmes, the preparedness of graduating resident physicians to treat obesity, and residency training programme director preferences for supporting faculty development to improve residency education in obesity management. This cross-sectional on-line survey of programme directors addressed the number of ABOM-certified faculty, perceived graduate preparedness to treat obesity, and priorities to improve faculty expertise and obesity curriculum. Of 672 eligible programme directors, 298 (44%) responded to our survey. Most programmes (76%) had no ABOM-certified faculty. The proportion of programme directors assessing their graduates as prepared to care for patients with obesity has significantly decreased in the last 5 years (2018: 74%, 2022: 58%, p =.016). Residents in programmes with ABOM-certified faculty member were more likely to be assessed as very prepared to provide medical care (18% vs. 7.8% p =.047). A majority (54%) of programme directors identified limited faculty training and expertise as the biggest faculty and resident-level barrier to quality obesity care. This study demonstrates an important trend towards increasing ABOM-certification among Family Medicine residency programme faculty and an urgent need to prioritise faculty development to improve faculty expertise and resident training to address the obesity epidemic.",10.1111/cob.12654,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9594-4116,55588124800.0,

Only one-third of individuals with T2D receive care as recommended by the American Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines. Effective strategies are needed to accelerate the implementation of guideline concordant T2D care. Methods: The Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D) is a statewide population health collaborative quality initiative (CQI) developed to improve the care of all people with T2D in Michigan. MCT2D has developed a learning health system with physician organizations and their constituent practices to support quality improvement initiatives focused on (1) improving use of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy to improve cardiorenal outcomes, (2) increasing evidence-based use of continuous glucose monitoring, and (3) supporting use of lower carbohydrate eating patterns. Results: Between 2021 and 2022, MCT2D recruited 28 of the 40 Michigan-based physician organizations participating in Blue Cross’ Physician Group Incentive Program with 336 constituent practices and 1357 physicians in primary care (304), endocrinology (21) and nephrology (11). In January 2022, baseline data included a sample of 96,140 unique individuals with T2D. The baseline HbA1c was ≤ 7.0% for 66.3% of patients (n = 32,787), while 14.9% of patients had a most recent HbA1c ≥ 8.0% (n = 7,393). The most recent body mass index (BMI) was ≥ 30.0 for 64.8% of patients (n = 38,516). Discussion: MCT2D has organized a statewide collaborative to recruit and engage a diverse and large set of physician organizations and their constituent practices. This is a promising opportunity to accelerate adoption of guideline-concordant care for people with T2D and may be a model for other state or regional collaboratives. Future directions include specific evidence-based interventions targeted at reducing diabetes-linked comorbidities and associated healthcare costs as well as strategies focused on T2D prevention among at-risk populations.",10.1186/s12913-024-11520-z,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-9594-4116,55588124800.0,

Published by Cambridge University Press.Background: Primary care providers (PCPs) are expected to help patients with obesity to lose weight through behavior change counseling and patient-centered use of available weight management resources. Yet, many PCPs face knowledge gaps and clinical time constraints that hinder their ability to successfully support patients' weight loss. Fortunately, a small and growing number of physicians are now certified in obesity medicine through the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) and can provide personalized and effective obesity treatment to individual patients. Little is known, however, about how to extend the expertise of ABOM-certified physicians to support PCPs and their many patients with obesity. Aim: To develop and pilot test an innovative care model-the Weight Navigation Program (WNP)-to integrate ABOM-certified physicians into primary care settings and to enhance the delivery of personalized, effective obesity care. Methods: Quality improvement program with an embedded, 12-month, single-arm pilot study. Patients with obesity and ≥1 weight-related co-morbidity may be referred to the WNP by PCPs. All patients seen within the WNP during the first 12 months of clinical operations will be compared to a matched cohort of patients from another primary care site. We will recruit a subset of WNP patients (n = 30) to participate in a remote weight monitoring pilot program, which will include surveys at 0, 6, and 12 months, qualitative interviews at 0 and 6 months, and use of an electronic health record (EHR)-based text messaging program for remote weight monitoring. Discussion: Obesity is a complex chronic condition that requires evidence-based, personalized, and longitudinal care. To deliver such care in general practice, the WNP leverages the expertise of ABOM-certified physicians, health system and community weight management resources, and EHR-based population health management tools. The WNP is an innovative model with the potential to be implemented, scaled, and sustained in diverse primary care settings.",10.1017/S1463423621000906,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0001-7134-970X,55588124800.0,
Joy Carol Williams,Developing a novel poverty in healthcare curriculum for medical students at the University of Michigan Medical School,2008.0,Academic Medicine,Review,"poverty, medical schools, poverty healthcare, medical students, medical education, healthcare curriculum, curriculum medical","Nearly 90 million Americans live below 200% of the federal poverty threshold. The links between lower socioeconomic status and poor health are clear, and all physicians face the resulting challenges in patient care. Current medical school curricula do not adequately prepare students to address this issue despite recommendations from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Institute of Medicine. In response, students and faculty at the University of Michigan Medical Center established the Poverty in Healthcare curriculum, which encompasses required learning experiences spanning all four years of undergraduate medical education. This article describes the design and implementation of this curriculum. The authors provide thorough descriptions of the individual learning experiences, including community site visits, longitudinal cases, mini-electives, and family centered experiences. The authors also discuss the history, costs, challenges, and evaluation process related to the Poverty in Healthcare curriculum, including issues specifically related to medical students' involvement in developing and implementing the curriculum.

Approach: In 2010, the University of Michigan Medical school began planning the Global Health and Disparities Path of Excellence (GHD Path), an optional co-curriculum for students interested in health disparities, with explicit goals to (1) draw attention to the school's social mission; (2) test new, faculty-intensive methods of learning and assessment for all students; and (3) serve as a template for additional co-curricular paths. Outcomes: Intended outcomes of the program include enhancing students' competency in leadership related to ameliorating health disparities and the study institution's ability to plan feasible and effective schoolwide reforms in self-directed learning, faculty advising systems, narrative-based feedback for goal setting, Web-based student portfolios, and additional Paths of Excellence. Next Steps: During academic year 2013-2014, the GHD Path is adding more community-based experiences. The faculty development and support model will be streamlined to decrease resources required for program development while retaining key features of the advising system. Lessons from the GHD Path are central to planning schoolwide reform of instructional methods, faculty advising, and student portfolios. The use of a small-scale program to pilot new ideas to inform longer-term, larger-scale changes at our institution might prove useful to other schools striving to meet societal needs while implementing innovative methods of instruction and assessment.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000000286,University of Michigan Medical School,,55499956900.0,

The etiology is uncertain but may be related to trauma. GCRG is difficult to distinguish from giant cell tumor of the bone and has a lower recurrence rate. Thirteen reports of temporal bone GCRG in 11 patients have been reported. One report of a petrous GCRG in a 3-year-old girl has been identified. A 38-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of fullness in his left ear, ipsilateral hearing loss, and intermittent cacosmia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large left-sided anterior temporal extradural mass. The patient underwent a left frontotemporal craniotomy and resection of a left temporal fossa tumor that involved the petrous and squamous parts of the temporal bone. The patient's post-operative course was uneventful, except for increased hearing loss secondary to opening of the epitympanum. Follow-up at one month revealed no other problems.

Joy Carol Williams,Promoting medical students' reflection on competencies to advance a global health equities curriculum,2014.0,BMC Medical Education,Article,Assessment; Curriculum development; Disparities; Global health; Medical education; Reflection; Assessment; Curriculum development; Disparities; Global health; Medical education; Reflection,"Background: The move to frame medical education in terms of competencies - the extent to which trainees ""can do"" a professional responsibility - is congruent with calls for accountability in medical education. However, the focus on competencies might be a poor fit with curricula intended to prepare students for responsibilities not emphasized in traditional medical education. This study examines an innovative approach to the use of potential competency expectations related to advancing global health equity to promote students' reflections and to inform curriculum development. Methods. In 2012, 32 medical students were admitted into a newly developed Global Health and Disparities (GHD) Path of Excellence. The GHD program takes the form of mentored co-curricular activities built around defined competencies related to professional development and leadership skills intended to ameliorate health disparities in medically underserved settings, both domestically and globally. Students reviewed the GHD competencies from two perspectives: a) their ability to perform the identified competencies that they perceived themselves as holding as they began the GHD program and b) the extent to which they perceived that their future career would require these responsibilities. For both sets of assessments the response scale ranged from ""Strongly Disagree"" to ""Strongly Agree."" Wilcoxon's paired T-tests compared individual students' ordinal rating of their current level of ability to their perceived need for competence that they anticipated their careers would require. Statistical significance was set at p <.01. Results: Students' ratings ranged from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree"" that they could perform the defined GHD-related competencies. However, on most competencies, at least 50 % of students indicated that the stated competencies were beyond their present ability level. For each competency, the results of Wilcoxon paired T-tests indicate - at statistically significant levels - that students perceive more need in their careers for GHD-program defined competencies than they currently possess. Conclusion: This study suggests congruence between student and program perceptions of the scope of practice required for GHD. Students report the need for enhanced skill levels in the careers they anticipate. This approach to formulating and reflecting on competencies will guide the program's design of learning experiences aligned with students' career goals. © 2014 Mullan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1472-6920-14-91,University of Michigan Medical School,,55499956900.0,

All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: Following the publication of Point-of-Care-Ultrasound (POCUS) curriculum guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians in 2016, there has been a rapid expansion in POCUS curricula across family medicine departments in the US. There is growing appreciation for the potential role of POCUS in enhancing the clinical care family physicians provide to patients. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the utilization of POCUS in outpatient clinic care across Family Medicine departments nationwide and to identify perceived or realized barriers in integrating POCUS use for clinic care. Methods: The questions were part of a larger omnibus survey of US Department of Family Medicine chairs, conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) between August 6 to August 31, 2021. Results: 81% of departments have at least 1 POCUS-trained faculty, with 44% of departments using POCUS in some ambulatory clinical care. Currently, only 6% have established billing for the POCUS they perform. Faculty time, as well as funding, for POCUS training were seen as 2 primary barriers. The purchasing of equipment and billing for POCUS were described by FMCs as difficult. Conclusions: As POCUS use continues to rise in Family Medicine, it is imperative to create a more efficient and less hindered road to growth. Collaboration across departments to share best practices in training, purchasing equipment and billing for POCUS will be important to facilitate high-quality POCUS access for our patients.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.04.220019,Michigan Medicine,0000-0002-3982-5507,57224507321.0,

Our primary aim was to compare HRQoL of 3 illness groups of outpatient adults: Those with diabetes, those who survived a hospitalization for COVID-19, and those who had a respiratory virus not COVID-19. The secondary aim was to compare the group domain summary scores to the referent general population. Methods: We identified the 3 groups from the electronic medical record and invited them to complete the SF-36 survey. Analysis of variance and post hoc testing was used for univariate analyses followed by linear regression. Results: One hundred thirty-Two adults completed the survey. The groups differed least for physical functioning and most for emotional/mental health. The hospitalized group had the greatest limitation in role due to emotional issues. All groups had significantly lower social functioning scores than the general population. Linear regression showed lower HRQoL domain score in role limitations due to emotional issues adjusted for age, race, and gender for the hospitalized group. Conclusion: SF-36 scores show the decrease in HRQoL that outpatient adults have suffered, mostly in the emotional domain, regardless of illness group during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, we developed and implemented a novel, self-directed, 2-week online elective for undergraduate medical students. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this course in increasing medical students’ competency and confidence in caring for SGM patients. Methods: We developed the curriculum using Kern’s six-step model for curriculum development. We created anonymous pre-and postcourse surveys using the standardized Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Survey (LGBT-DOCSS) questionnaire to assess cultural competence, as well as a 5-point Likert-scored survey to assess self-perceived confidence in the care of SGM patients. We tested the statistical significance in pre-and postsurvey scores via paired sample t tests in R (R Project for Statistical Computing). Results: We found statistically significant increases in the LGBT-DOCSS categories of clinical preparedness (P<.001), basic knowledge (P<.001), overall competency (P<.001), and self-perceived confidence in caring for SGM patients (P<.001, N=33). Conclusions: The course represents an effective solution for increasing medical students’ self-perceived competence and confidence in caring for SGM patients.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Background and Objectives: It is well established that provider lack of knowledge in the field of transgender and nonbinary health is as ignificant barrier to care and that training in this area is lacking. This study examined how family medicine residents’ self-confidence and medical knowledge in providing gender-affirming care changed after completing a novel, online curriculum on transgender and nonbinary care. Methods: Thirty-nine family medicine residents were invited to complete the curriculum. Change inself-confidence was determined by the difference in scores on a Likert scale on a pre- and post-survey. Change in medical knowledge was assessed by examining the difference between pre- and post-test scores on a novel multiple-choice examination. Results: Only 7% of current residents agreed that their current training is adequate in order to provide comprehensive primary care to transgender and nonbinary people. After completion of the curriculum, 100% of participants felt at least somewhat confident providing primary care to transgender and nonbinary people, including hormone therapy.

However, a paucity of data describes how GAHT influences fracture rate over time. The study's primary objective was to describe the 5-year all-cause fracture incidence rate (IR) among TGD patients initiating estrogen-based GAHT (E-GAHT) or testosterone-based GAHT (T-GAHT), compared with TGD patients not using GAHT (non-GAHT).Methods:This retrospective cohort study of TGD adults aged 18 to 65 years used insurance data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database (MarketScan) from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. The main outcome was IR (IR with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of all-cause fracture after up to 5 years of follow-up. The IR ratio was estimated by comparing E-GAHT and T-GAHT groups with the non-GAHT group. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of fracture after adjusting for age, comorbidity status using Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), recent fractures, and study start year.Results:Nine thousand six hundred ninety-six TGD adults (E-GAHT [n = 1,131]; T-GAHT [n = 1,046]; non-GAHT [n = 7,519]) were identified using clinical and enrollment criteria.

The SRNs followed a script and assessed students using a rubric, then provided immediate verbal feedback on the students’ clinical management and communication skills. We recorded, de-identified, transcribed, and coded feedback, then determined themes. Seventy-six students participated and 162 encounters were recorded. We developed nine codes and identified two themes: positive reinforcement and authentic clinical feedback. The SRNs connected the cases to real-life experiences, reflecting upon mistakes or interactions they have made, to emphasize learning points for the student. This non-scripted, authentic clinical feedback reinforced the feedback provided on specific domains including information gathering, communication, and clinical management.

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of text message surveys in a clinical setting and to describe key lessons to minimize attrition. Methods: We obtained a convenience sample of individuals who entered the waiting room of a low-income, primary care clinic. Participants were asked to answer between 17 and 30 survey questions on a variety of health-related topics, including both open- and closed-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the participants and determine the response rates. Bivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of incomplete surveys. Results: Our convenience sample consisted of 461 individuals. Of those who attempted the survey, 80% (370/461) completed it in full. The mean age of respondents was 35.4 years (standard deviation = 12.4). Respondents were predominantly non-Hispanic black (42%) or non-Hispanic white (41%), female (75%), and with at least some college education (70%). Of those who completed the survey, 84% (312/370) reported willingness to do another text message survey. Those with incomplete surveys answered a median of nine questions before stopping. Smartphone users were less likely to leave the survey incomplete compared with non-smartphone users (p = 0.004). Discussion: Text-message surveys are a feasible and acceptable method to collect real-time data among low-income, clinic-based populations.

Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,,57203951781.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Women with medical conditions are at higher risk of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality than women without medical conditions. Thus, women who do not desire pregnancy should be offered contraceptive counseling and methods. The objective of this qualitative study was to identify potential best practices to guide primary care physicians (PCPs) in providing contraception and contraceptive counseling for women with medical conditions. METHODS: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews of 10 PCPs who routinely provide contraception including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). To inform the data collection and analysis, we adapted constructs from the Theoretical Domains Framework. We coded transcripts and identified themes until saturation of our theoretical constructs was achieved. RESULTS: Physician time constraints, lack of patient knowledge, and competing demands related to medical condition management were identified as barriers to contraceptive care. The study participants reported multiple strategies to mitigate these barriers. They emphasized providing reproductive health education in the context of an individual’s chronic conditions and medications, educating about LARC methods, and using the US Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC) as a point-of-care clinical tool to guide contraceptive selection. CONCLUSIONS: The study participants (PCPs experienced in contraceptive care), described multifaceted approaches to providing contraception for women with medical conditions, including tailored contraceptive education and use of the US MEC for clinical guidance. Future research is needed to assess if such strategies can improve patient outcomes and be adopted by PCPs who have less experience with contraceptive care.",10.22454/FamMed.2019.499467,Michigan Medicine,,57203951781.0,

The aim of this qualitative study was to develop a theoretical model that reflects contraceptive decision-making and behaviour in the setting of diabetes mellitus. Methods: We conducted semi-structured, qualitative interviews of 17 women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from Michigan, USA. Participants were recruited from a diabetes registry and local clinics. We adapted domains from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and applied reproductive justice principles to inform the qualitative data collection and analysis. Using an iterative coding template, we advanced from descriptive to theoretical codes, compared codes across characteristics of interest (e.g. diabetes type), and synthesized the theoretical codes and their relationships in an explanatory model. Results: The final model included the following constructs and themes: perceived barriers and benefits to contraceptive use (effects on blood sugar, risk of diabetes-related complications, improved quality of life); perceived seriousness of pregnancy (harm to self, harm to foetus or baby); perceived susceptibility to pregnancy risks (diabetes is a ‘high risk’ state); external cues to action (one-size-fits-all/anxiety-provoking counselling vs. personalized/trust-based counselling); internal cues to action (self-perceived ‘sickness’); self-efficacy (reproductive self-efficacy, contraceptive self-efficacy); and modifying factors (perceptions of biased counselling based upon one’s age, race or severity of disease).

Although evidence based guidelines for contraceptive selection in the presence of medical conditions are available via the United States Medical Eligibility Criteria (US MEC), these guidelines are underutilized. Research also supports the use of decision tools to promote shared decision making between patients and providers during contraceptive counseling. Objective: The overall goal of the MiHealth, MiChoice project is to design and implement a theory-driven, Web-based tool that incorporates the US MEC (provider-level intervention) within the vehicle of a contraceptive decision tool for women with chronic medical conditions (patient-level intervention) in community-based primary care settings (practice-level intervention). This will be a 3-phase study that includes a predesign phase, a design phase, and a testing phase in a randomized controlled trial. This study protocol describes phase 1 and aim 1, which is to determine patient-, provider-, and practice-level factors that are relevant to the design and implementation of the contraceptive decision tool. Methods: This is a mixed methods implementation study. To customize the delivery of the US MEC in the decision tool, we selected high-priority constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Theoretical Domains Framework to drive data collection and analysis at the practice and provider level, respectively. A conceptual model that incorporates constructs from the transtheoretical model and the health beliefs model undergirds patient-level data collection and analysis and will inform customization of the decision tool for this population. We will recruit 6 community-based primary care practices and conduct quantitative surveys and semistructured qualitative interviews with women who have chronic medical conditions, their primary care providers (PCPs), and clinic staff, as well as field observations of practice activities. Quantitative survey data will be summarized with simple descriptive statistics and relationships between participant characteristics and contraceptive recommendations (for PCPs), and current contraceptive use (for patients) will be examined using Fisher exact test. We will conduct thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and field observations. The integration of data will occur by comparing, contrasting, and synthesizing qualitative and quantitative findings to inform the future development and implementation of the intervention. Results: We are currently enrolling practices and anticipate study completion in 15 months. Conclusions: This protocol describes the first phase of a multiphase mixed methods study to develop and implement a Web-based decision tool that is customized to meet the needs of women with chronic medical conditions in primary care settings. Study findings will promote contraceptive counseling via shared decision making and reflect evidence-based guidelines for contraceptive selection.",10.2196/resprot.9249,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,
Justine Peen Wu,Are the contraceptive recommendations of family medicine educators evidence-based?: A CERA survey,2016.0,Family Medicine,Article,Family,"2016, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Our study aims were to: (1) describe the scope of contraceptive methods provided by US family medicine educators and (2) assess the extent to which US family medicine educators’ recommendations regarding eligibility criteria for contraceptive methods are consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. METHODS: We contributed survey items as part of the 2014 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) omnibus survey, which is distributed annually to a national cohort of US family medicine educators. We created two summary scales, comprised of clinical scenarios, to assess the extent to which provider recommendations regarding eligibility criteria for oral contraceptive pills (OCPs, six scenarios) and the intrauterine device (IUD, eight scenarios) were consistent with CDC guidelines. RESULTS: Among the 1,054 respondents (33% response rate), 98% prescribe OCPs and 66% insert IUDs. The OCP scale mean was 4.6 ± SD 1.6 (range 0–6), and the IUD scale mean was 4.8 SD ± 2.3 (range 0–8). These scores reflect that 23% of providers’ OCP recommendations and 40% of their IUD recommendations were inconsistent with CDC guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The contraceptive recommendations of this cohort of family medicine educators only partially reflected evidence-based guidelines. More misconceptions were noted regarding eligibility criteria for the IUD than for OCPs. To avoid denying safe and effective contraception to otherwise appropriate candidates and putting women at risk of unintended pregnancy, evidence-based contraceptive recommendations must be improved among family medicine educators.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Family physicians play an important role in delivery of family planning services, but many factors impact scope of prac-tice. One important factor is the development of subspecialties, such as the new subspecialty within obstetrics and gynecology called complex family planning (CFP). METHODS: In 2019, we conducted a survey of family medicine department chairs as part of the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance survey. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to test for associations between program and chair characteristics, knowledge of CFP, and attitudes regarding family planning services (complex contraceptive counseling, pregnancy options counseling, first trimester miscarriage manage-ment, and pregnancy termination). RESULTS: The survey response rate was 54% (105/193). Only 8% of respondents were aware of the CFP subspecialty. The majority of chairs considered all queried family planning services as part of family medicine’s scope of practice, including pregnancy termination by medication abortion (77%) and by uterine aspiration (60%). Chairs of departments with a faculty champion in family planning had higher odds of advocating for all queried family planning services as part of family medicine scope of practice (OR 3.0, 1.1-8.2) than those without a faculty champion. CONCLUSIONS: Few chairs are aware of the new subspecialty of CFP, but most would advocate to maintain some form of abortion care in family medicine’s scope of practice. Given family medicine’s role in the health care safety net, supporting faculty champions in family planning is important to preserve access to family planning services for marginalized communities.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.157121,University of Washington School of Medicine,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

Study design: We conducted 41 interviews with pre-menopausal patients with a range of medical conditions from Michigan, United States. We identified themes through open coding and comparative analysis until we reached theoretical saturation. We analyzed the themes in the context of the Health Belief Model constructs and patient autonomy. To develop the explanatory model, we qualitatively mapped out relationships between constructs and how they informed contraceptive-decision making. Results: The model posits that contraceptive decisions are affected by the perceived impact of chronic disease on pregnancy, parenting, and contraceptive options. These perceptions were strongly affected by others, particularly health care providers (HCPs). Most worried that pregnancy could threaten their health, fetal health, or ability to parent. Active symptoms of chronic disease (e.g., pain, fatigue) amplified this perceived threat. Patients appreciated when their HCPs acknowledged, rather than dismissed, their concerns about contraceptive side effects that affected their chronic disease symptoms and management (e.g., headaches, worsening mood). Patients with medical contraindications to hormonal contraception and preferred to use coital-dependent methods (e.g., condoms) did not feel supported to do so by their HCPs. Patients who were Black, young, living on low-incomes, or considered medically “high risk” felt discriminated against by HCPs who limited or coerced their contraceptive decisions. Conclusions: This explanatory model synthesizes factors that underlie, constrain, or promote reproductive and contraceptive decisions and autonomy for individuals with medical conditions. Implications: This new explanatory model can guide the development and evaluation of interventions that support the contraceptive decisions and autonomy of individuals with medical conditions.",10.1016/j.contraception.2022.03.021,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,
Justine Peen Wu,"Emergency contraception: Links between providers' counseling choices, prescribing behaviors, and sociopolitical context",2019.0,Social Science and Medicine,Article,Emergency contraception; Medical decision-making; Politics; Pregnancy; Provider views; United States; Emergency contraception; Medical decision-making; Politics; Pregnancy; Provider views; United States,"2019 Elsevier LtdHealthcare decisions depend on the characteristics of patients and providers. However, how these decisions are influenced by provider interpretations of biological processes and the sociopolitical context in which they work remains unclear. To answer these questions, we explore providers' prescribing of emergency contraception (EC), methods that can prevent pregnancy after sex has already occurred. Despite the consensus mainstream medical definition that pregnancy begins after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, an alternative perspective holds that pregnancy instead begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg. How providers define pregnancy may affect their willingness to prescribe EC. However, the ability of providers to recommend treatments consistent with their understandings of medical processes may depend on the sociopolitical context in which the patient-provider interaction occurs. We test whether EC prescribing practices vary by providers' definition of pregnancy and the interaction of this definition with the sociopolitical context in which they practice. Data from U.S. medical providers were collected as part of a survey on EC knowledge and practices (N = 1308). We merged voting results from the county in which the provider practices to data on provider EC prescribing and pregnancy counseling practices. Because recent Republican party platforms have explicitly endorsed a definition of pregnancy that begins at fertilization and party advocacy frequently uses this definition, we use the county vote share for the Republican presidential candidate as a contextual measure of views that pregnancy begins at fertilization. We find a significant interaction such that providers who counsel that pregnancy begins at fertilization are significantly less likely to prescribe EC if they practice in counties with higher Republican vote shares. Our results highlight that patient access to EC may depend on both place of residence and provider views and that providers' EC prescribing may depend jointly on their understanding of pregnancy and sociopolitical context.",10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112588,Texas Tech University,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.Objective: To compare female sterilization among three mutually exclusive groups of females: 1) those without any self-reported disability, 2) those with noncognitive disabilities (sensory or physical disabilities), and 3) those with cognitive disabilities. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of nationally representative data from the National Survey of Family Growth 2011-2015, which surveyed individuals aged 15-44 years in the U.S. civilian population. Disability status (self-reported) was ascertained using a standard set of questions about hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living difficulties. Regression models were used to calculate odds of female sterilization, hysterectomies, and age of sterilization while accounting for sociodemographic differences. Results: Female sterilization rates were higher among females with cognitive (22.1% [n5272]) and noncognitive disabilities (24.7% [n5150]) than among those without disabilities (14.8% [n51,132]). After adjusting for sociodemographic covariates, females with cognitive disabilities had significantly higher odds of female sterilization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% CI 1.19-1.98, P<. 01) and hysterectomy (adjusted OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.53-4.56, P<.001) than those without cognitive disabilities.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Objective Gender-affirming hormones (GAH)-the use of sex hormones to induce desired secondary sex characteristics in transgender individuals-is vital healthcare for many transgender people. Among prescribers of GAH, there is debate regarding the value of a universal requirement for an evaluation by a mental health provider prior to GAH initiation. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the range of attitudes and approaches to mental health evaluation among GAH providers in the United States. We analyzed the providers' attitudes and base our recommendations on this analysis. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 healthcare providers who prescribe GAH across the United States. Participants were purposefully recruited using professional networks and snowball sampling to include those who require mental health evaluation and those who do not. We adapted domains from the Theoretical Domains Framework-a framework for understanding influences on health professional behavior-to inform the interviews and analysis. Guided by these domains, we iteratively coded text and identified theoretical relationships among the categories. Results While some felt a universal requirement for mental health ""clearance""was necessary for the identification of appropriate candidates for GAH, others described this requirement as a form of ""gatekeeping""that limits access to care. Themes we identified included providers' ability to ascertain gender identity; concern about mental illness; GAH provider and mental health provider expertise; and provider roles. All providers appreciated the potential advantages of mental health support during GAH treatment. Conclusion Providers in our study practice on a continuum of care rather than adhering to strict rules about the requirement for mental health evaluation prior to GAH treatment. Where they fall on this continuum is influenced primarily by their perceptions of transgender identity and transition, and their interpretation of risk for significant mental illness and its association with transness. Providers who required universal evaluation by a mental health professional tended to hold essentialist, medicalized, and binary ideas of gender and transness.",10.1371/journal.pone.0271785,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

Methods: We analyzed longitudinal data from a population-based study of young adult women aged 18 and 19 who were representative of a single county in southeastern Michigan. Using multinomial logistic regression, we identified associations between contraceptive consistency (dependent outcome) and sociodemographic characteristics and personal factors. Findings: We categorized women into three patterns of contraceptive consistency: 1) always consistent (40%; reference group), 2) sometimes consistent (49%), 3) never consistent (11%). Not being employed was associated with increased odds of being sometimes consistent (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.2) and never consistent (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4). Those who reported a grade point average of 3.0 or less were more likely to be never consistent (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.3). Women in a serious relationship had a two times greater odds of being sometimes consistent. Among always consistent users, the oral contraceptive pill was most often used (55%); only 4% used the intrauterine device or implant. Sometimes consistent and never consistent users most frequently relied on condoms (35%) and withdrawal (68%), respectively. Conclusions: This analysis of longitudinal data revealed that the majority of young adult women inconsistently used short-acting or coital-specific methods; few used the most effective, long-acting methods. Interventions to improve contraceptive consistency among young adult women should include periodic assessments of personal factors (i.e., work, school, relationships) and promotion of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods when appropriate.",10.1016/j.whi.2016.02.007,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

To date, however, no national population-based studies have examined pregnancy ­intendedness among U.S. women with disabilities. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of data from the 2011–2013 and 2013–2015 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth were conducted; the sample included 5,861 pregnancies reported by 3,089 women. The proportion of pregnancies described as unintended was calculated for women with any type of disability, women with each of five types of disabilities and women with no disabilities. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship of disability status and type with pregnancy intendedness while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: A higher proportion of pregnancies were unintended among women with disabilities than among women without disabilities (53% vs. 36%). Women with independent living disability had the highest proportion of unintended pregnancies (62%). In regression analyses, the odds that a pregnancy was unintended were greater among women with any type of disability than among women without disabilities (odds ratio, 1.4), and were also elevated among women with hearing disability, cognitive disability or independent living disability (1.5–1.9).

Justine Peen Wu,Provision of moderately and highly effective reversible contraception to insuredwomen with intellectual and developmental disabilities,2018.0,Obstetrics and Gynecology,Article,Contraception; Developmental Disabilities,"2018 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.OBJECTIVE: To estimate provision of moderately and highly effective reversible contraceptives to women with intellectual and developmental disabilities. METHODS: We used data from the Massachusetts All- Payer Claims Database to identify women aged 15-44 years with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities who were continuously enrolled in a private commercial insurance plan, Medicaid, or Medicare in 2012. We calculated the percentage of women aged 15-44 years who were not medically or surgically sterile and were provided 1) highly effective, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC, the intrauterine device or subdermal implant); or 2) prescriptions for moderately effective methods (pill, patch, ring, shot, or diaphragm). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of LARC and moderately effective method provision by disability status, adjusted for age, income, and Medicaid receipt. RESULTS: Among 915,561 women who were not medically or surgically sterile, 13,059 women (1.4%) had at least one intellectual and developmental disability. Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities were less likely to be provided LARC (2.1% vs 4.2%, P,.001, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.38-0.48, P,.001) and moderately effective methods (21.1% vs 29.9%, P,.001, adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.71, P,.001) than women without intellectual and developmental disabilities. The one exception was the progestin shot, which was provided more often to women with intellectual and developmental disabilities than women without these disabilities (14.7% vs 4.3%, P,.001). Among a subset of women who only received moderately effective methods or LARC (n5310,344), women with intellectual and developmental disability had lower odds of receiving LARC than moderately effective methods (adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.67). CONCLUSION: The study findings raise concerns that the provision of LARC and moderately effective methods differs based on the presence of intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with 21 TGNB individuals who have sought or are receiving hormones. We purposively sampled respondents who were (n = 12) and were not (n = 8) required to provide a letter. An Advisory Board of transgender individuals guided the methodology. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded both inductively and deductively. Results: We identified three themes related to the letter requirement: (1) Mental health: While participants appreciated the importance of therapy, the letter requirement did not serve this purpose; (2) Trans identity: The process of obtaining a letter created doubt in participants’ own transness, along with a resistance to the pathologization and conflation of mental illness with transness; and (3) Care relationships: The letter requirement negatively impacted the patient-provider relationship. Participants felt the need to self-censor or to perform a version of transness they thought the provider expected; this process decreased their trust in care professionals. Conclusion: A letter requirement did not improve mental health and had several negative consequences. Removal of this requirement will improve access to hormones and may paradoxically improve mental health.",10.1089/trgh.2022.0024,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,
Justine Peen Wu,The politics of place: Presidential voting patterns and providers' prescription of emergency contraception,2018.0,Contraception,Article,Access to contraception; Emergency contraception; Levonorgestrel; Politics and medicine; Ulipristal acetate; Access to contraception; Emergency contraception; Levonorgestrel; Politics and medicine; Ulipristal acetate,"2018 Elsevier Inc.Objective: The most effective forms of emergency contraception (EC) require a prescription or a medical procedure; therefore, provider willingness to offer EC remains critical to patient access. This study seeks to assess whether political alignment of a provider's county is associated with provider attitudes and behaviors regarding EC. Study design: We analyzed survey data collected from 1313 healthcare providers from February 2013 to April 2014 at 14 academic medical centers in the United States. Using logistic regression, we estimated associations between the county political alignment of a provider's practice and his or her EC-related beliefs and practices: 1) if the provider is aware of the most effective EC methods; 2) if knowing that a hypothetical EC method prevented implantation would make a provider less likely to prescribe that method because of personal ethical or religious reasons; and 3) if the provider prescribes any form of EC in his or her practice. Results: In multivariate models, a one percentage-point increase in county Republican vote share was associated with a 2.9% decrease in the odds of a provider prescribing EC, after accounting for provider knowledge and attitudes about EC. Conclusions: EC provides a critical last chance to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex, yet women living in Republican-leaning counties may face difficulty obtaining EC from healthcare providers. Programs seeking to improve access to EC should focus on areas likely to have fewer providers willing to prescribe EC, which may be those that are more Republican-leaning. Implications: The most effective forms of emergency contraception require a prescription or a medical procedure; therefore, provider willingness to offer EC remains critical to patient access. Women living in Republican-leaning counties may face difficulty obtaining emergency contraception from healthcare providers.",10.1016/j.contraception.2018.05.013,Princeton University,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

Study design: We analyzed data from four open-ended questions and demographic items collected through MyVoice, a national text message survey of youth aged 14–24. We calculated descriptive statistics to summarize awareness of and opinions about Title X. We integrated the quantitative findings with qualitative themes to achieve deeper understanding of the beliefs that inform youth opinions. Results: Seven hundred and fifty youth responded to the text message survey (58.0% response rate). The majority (74.9%) was unaware of recent Title X changes. Most (79.3%) were unsupportive of these changes, and a sizable portion (40%) worried these changes could impact them. Opposition to Title X changes was based upon five themes: (1) youth need to be aware of their health options, including abortion; (2) the policy will undermine reproductive rights; (3) the policy is unfair; (4) the policy is unconstitutional; (5) the policy will threaten public health and health services, including affordable and safe abortion. Those who supported Title X changes (13.8%) described moral objections to abortion and beliefs that the government should not be responsible for abortion care. Conclusions: Most youth in this sample were unsupportive of Title X changes. Limited youth awareness of Title X changes suggests that better youth outreach is needed regarding sexual and reproductive health (SRH) policies. Implications: Although youth represent 40% of clients who receive SRH services through Title X, more efforts are needed to inform and engage them in salient policy changes that may directly affect their SRH health and health care access.",10.1016/j.contraception.2020.10.008,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-4646-8410,56055377000.0,

Many men experience these types of urinary symptoms.

Published by IOS Press.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to characterize health related quality of life (HRQOL) in Japanese patients after bladder cancer surgery and to perform cross-cultural comparison between Japanese and American patients. METHODS: Firstly, we cross-sectionally assessed HRQOL of 371 patients in Japan using the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI-Japanese). HRQOL of the four groups of patients (native bladder without intravesical therapy, native bladder with intravesical therapy, cystectomy with ileal conduit, and cystectomy with neobladder) were assessed. Secondly, we compared the Japanese with the American cohort (n = 315) from the original BCI paper. After adjusting for age and gender, the differences in each BCI subdomain score was analyzed. RESULTS: Among Japanese patients, the urinary domain function score was significantly lower among the cystectomy with neobladder group, compared to the cystectomy with ileal conduit group (p < 0. 01). Despite this, the urinary bother was comparable between the two groups. Although there were apparent differences between Japanese and American patients, there were few differences in Urinary and Bowel HRQOL. In three of the four treatment groups (other than native bladder with intravesical therapy), Japanese patients were more likely than Americans to report poor sexual function (p < 0.05). However, Japanese patients were less likely than Americans to be bothered by their lower sexual function, regardless of treatment (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL outcomes following treatment of bladder cancer in Japan are comparable to those in the USA, except for sexual functioning and sexual bother. The BCI can be used for cross-cultural assessments of HRQOL in bladder cancer patients.",10.3233/BLC-200359,Graduate School of Medicine,0000-0002-2833-3259,36247834600.0,

The common sexual dysfunctions in men have significant overlap. Low sexual desire in men includes a lack of interest in thinking about sex or in being sexual, alone or with a partner. Sexual health counseling often is helpful. Physicians should prescribe supplemental testosterone only if it is clearly indicated. (Sexual dysfunction is an off-label use of testosterone.) Supplementation is not beneficial for men with a normal total testosterone level. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain a penile erection sufficient for sexual satisfaction. The cause typically is multifactorial. The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are the first-line pharmacotherapies for most patients with ED. Their use is contraindicated in patients taking nitrates. Peyronie disease is an acquired penile abnormality that causes curvature or other deformities of the erect penis. Premature ejaculation is defined as a lack of ejaculatory control that is associated with distress. All pharmacotherapies for premature ejaculation are used off label. First-line treatment options include daily selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, paroxetine), on-demand clomipramine, and topical penile anesthetics. Psychotherapeutic and physical therapies also have been shown to be effective.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2833-3259,36247834600.0,

Common palpable benign scrotal masses include spermatocele, varicocele, and hydrocele. Most patients with these masses require no treatment. Some varicoceles are associated with impaired fertility, probably due to an increase in scrotal temperature that leads to testicular hyperthermia, oxidative stress, and reduced spermatogenesis. Patients with documented infertility or scrotal pain should be referred to a urology subspecialist for consideration of surgical management. Epididymitis and epididymo-orchitis are caused by infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or enteric bacteria. Antibiotics and supportive measures (eg, scrotal elevation, bed rest) are recommended for management of acute epididymitis. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency that requires rapid surgical exploration and orchidopexy to reduce the risk of testicular loss due to ischemia. Salvage rates exceed 90% when surgical exploration is performed within 6 hours of symptom onset. Testicular cancer commonly manifests as a painless, incidentally discovered mass in a single testis. Ultrasonography is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. The recommended primary intervention for a suspected malignant testicular tumor is radical inguinal orchiectomy.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2833-3259,36247834600.0,

At the time of birth, undescended testis, or cryptorchidism, is present in 2-4% of full-term newborn males; in preterm males, the rate is 20-30%. The potential complications associated with undescended testis include infertility, testicular cancer, and testicular torsion. Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord twists, blocking blood flow to the testis. This is a surgical emergency for which rapid recognition and treatment are essential. Irreversible changes due to ischemia in the affected testis start within hours. Vasectomy is the most effective form of contraception available for men.

No published data exist regarding the views of patients and family members in LMICs regarding this practice. Methods and Results: An article questionnaire eliciting attitudes regarding pacemaker reuse was administered to ambulatory adult patients and patients' family members at outpatient clinics at Centro Nacional Cardiologia in Managua, Nicaragua, Indus Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, Hospital Carlos Andrade Marín, and Hospital Eugenio Espejo in Quito, Ecuador, and American University of Beirut Medical Center in Beirut, Lebanon. There were 945 responses (Nicaragua – 100; Pakistan – 493; Ecuador – 252; and Lebanon – 100). A majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to accept a reused pacemaker if risks were similar to a new device (707, 75%), if there were a higher risk of device failure compared with a new device (584, 70%), or if there were a higher risk of infection compared to a new device (458, 56%). A large majority would be willing to donate their own pacemaker at the time of their death (884, 96%) or the device of a family member (805, 93%). Respondents who were unable to afford a new device were more likely to be willing to accept a reused device (79% vs. 63%, p <.001). Conclusions: Patients and their family members support the concept of pacemaker reuse for patients who cannot afford new devices.",10.1111/jce.15367,Trinity Health Michigan,,57215313656.0,

All rights reserved.Problem Transforming medical school curricula to train physicians to better address society's needs is a complex task, as students must develop expertise in areas other than clinical medicine. Approach In 2010, the University of Michigan Medical School (UMMS) launched the Global Health and Disparities (GHD) Path of Excellence as part of a larger curriculum transformation. The GHD Path is a co-curriculum with the goal of ameliorating health disparities in the United States and abroad. It was developed iteratively based on student and faculty feedback. Student feedback emphasized the value of the relationships with faculty and other students, the capstone project, and exposure to role models and professional networks. Faculty described the joy of interacting with students and the desire for recognition by their departments for their role as an advisor. Outcomes Informed by the GHD Path experience, UMMS embraced the Path model, which emphasized professional relationships, career development, and high-impact scholarly work, making it different from the traditional medical curriculum, and the school implemented 7 other Paths between 2013 and 2018. Elements common to all Paths include a capstone project, a longitudinal advisor separate from the capstone advisor, exposure to role models and leaders, and the dissemination of scholarly work to promote networking. Next Steps Next steps for the Paths of Excellence include developing methods to systematically monitor students' progress, facilitating mentoring skills in and recognizing faculty advisors, and measuring the long-term impact of the Paths on students and society.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000002783,University of Michigan Medical School,,57215313656.0,

Domains assessed included perceived pandemic threat; value, existence, and barriers to creating personal disaster plans; staff absenteeism estimates; barriers to work attendance. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis with identification and coding of common themes, respectively.Results All 12 invited leaders participated and believed a personal disaster plan was important but only 2 had plans. None had ever discussed with their staff the importance of having a personal disaster plan. Two common barriers in creating a plan were low threat perception level and never considering the possibility of pandemic influenza. Only half of respondents could list common barriers preventing staff from working. Staff were confident employees would come to work during a disaster.Conclusion Outpatient primary care leaders may hold misconceptions regarding future disasters, underestimate their potential impact on clinics, and lack personal preparedness. Further investigation and interventions are needed to ensure clinics can be prepared so they can function and help hospital and emergency services when disasters strike.

Women and children have extremely high levels of poverty and face numerous barriers to care including lack of trust and racial disparities in care and concrete barriers such as limited transportation and childcare, work hour conflicts, and lack of insurance. Description: We report on a unique model of patient care focused on providing patient-centered care and building trusting relationships. This model is encompassed in a new free, volunteer-run, faith-based clinic which offers prenatal, postpartum, and infant care. Assessment: In the first 2 years of operation, demand for services rose rapidly and there were stellar clinical outcomes, despite the fact that Luke patients are among the medically and socially highest risk populations in the nation. Conclusion: While marginalized populations have worse birth outcomes and far more infant deaths, making care accessible and responsive to patient needs while focusing on building patient relationships is an important strategy to improve outcomes.",10.1007/s10995-020-02927-1,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,8359341.0
Katherine Jo Gold,An iterative design process to develop a randomized feasibility study and inform recruitment of minority women after stillbirth,2019.0,Pilot and Feasibility Studies,Article,Stillbirth; Stillbirth,"2019 The Author(s).Background: Yearly, approximately 25,000 US women experience stillbirth and African American women have a 2.2 fold increased risk of stillbirth compared with white women. After stillbirth, women are subject to a sevenfold increased risk of post-traumatic stress compared with women after a live-birth. This paper presents findings from phase one of a National Institutes of Health funded, two-phase feasibility study to examine an online yoga intervention to reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress in mothers after stillbirth. An iterative design was used to (1) inform the development of the online yoga intervention and (2) inform recruitment strategies to enroll minority women into phase two. Methods: Ten mothers (N = 5 stillbirth moms with no yoga experience, N = 5 nonstillbirth moms with yoga experience) participated in a series of online yoga videos (N = 30) and were assessed for self-compassion (SC) and emotional regulation (ER) before and after each video. An independent group of five minority women who had experienced stillbirth were interviewed about cultural barriers to recruitment and perceptions/opinions of yoga. A mean was calculated for SC and ER scores for each video at pre- and post-time points. The percent change of the mean difference between pre-post SC and ER scores were used to select videos for phase two. Videos with a negative change score or that had a 0% change on SC or ER were not used. A combination of deductive and inductive coding was used to organize the interview data, generate categories, and develop themes. Results: Five of the 30 tested yoga videos were not used. An additional 12 videos were developed, filmed, and used in the prescription for phase two. Topics from interview findings included perceived benefits/barriers of and interest in yoga, preferred yoga environment, suggested recruitment methods, content of recruitment material, and recommended incentives. Conclusions: Online yoga may be beneficial for improving emotional regulation and self-compassion, but further testing is needed. Additionally, minority women express interest in online yoga but suggest that researchers apply culturally specific strategies regarding methods, content of material, and incentives to recruit minority women into a study.",10.1186/s40814-019-0526-2,Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix Campus,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,8359341.0

We sought to survey clinicians about stillbirth bereavement care practices at U.S. hospitals and to evaluate care by hospital birth volume. Methods: Using American Hospital Association data, we employed stratified random sampling to select 300 hospitals from all centers with at least 100 annual deliveries. Within each state, we divided all hospitals into size quartiles and randomly selected from each until we reached the goal number per state. We then identified a staff member knowledgeable about typical bereavement care on labor and delivery at each hospital and sent an on-line survey about care. We linked survey data with hospital characteristics and used summary statistics, Chi squared, and Fisher’s Exact test to compare care by hospital birth volume. Results: We reached an eligible respondent at 429/551 hospitals and 396 of the 429 (73%) agreed to participate. We received 289 usable surveys for an overall response rate of 67%. Only one third of hospitals (n = 96, 33%) reported staff protected time for perinatal bereavement care. Of 17 bereavement topics, just six were routinely offered by at least two-thirds of the hospitals. Financial limitations and staff shortages were the most commonly identified barriers to care and were most pronounced at small-volume hospitals. Conclusions for Practice: This study offers a snapshot in bereavement care and identified important gaps for both large and small hospitals.",10.1007/s10995-023-03861-8,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,8359341.0

New interns typically learn the sterile cervical exam on the job by examining women in labor. This can be uncomfortable for patients and may increase the risk of infection. Simulated training could minimize these challenges, but manufactured models are expensive and not widely available in residency programs. We sought to evaluate a simple, homemade sewn model using stretchy fabric and pipe cleaners that could improve teaching and acquisition of cervical examination skills and common obstetrical procedures. Methods: We used the model to teach cervical examination skills to students and new interns and assessed participant satisfaction. We evaluated examination accuracy by grading practice exams on the model before and after a workshop teaching obstetrical procedures including the sterile vaginal exam. We calculated satisfaction using summary statistics. We evaluated pre-and postscores for exam accuracy using paired t tests. Results: Interns demonstrated a significant improvement in cervical exam skills using the model, and participants reported very high satisfaction with the workshop utilizing the model. Conclusions: We developed a simple, low-cost cervical exam model that was shown to be well-regarded by trainees and could be duplicated by other residency programs. This approach provides a unique and accessible way to offer hands-on simulation during obstetrical training. The model may improve trainees’ understanding of the procedures which would lead to better experiences for obstetrical patients.",10.22454/FamMed.55.284433,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,

Katherine Jo Gold,Measuring EQ-5D-5L utility values in parents who have experienced perinatal death,2024.0,European Journal of Health Economics,Article,EQ-5D; Foetal death; Health utility values; I1; I19; Neonatal death; Stillbirth; EQ-5D; Foetal death; Health utility values; I1; I19; Neonatal death; Stillbirth,"The Author(s) 2024.Background: Policymakers use clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence to support decisions about health service commissioning. In England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that in cost-effectiveness analyses “effectiveness” is measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), derived from health utility values. The impact of perinatal death (stillbirth/neonatal death) on parents’ health utility is currently unknown. This knowledge would improve the robustness of cost-effectiveness evidence for policymakers. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the impact of perinatal death on parents’ health utility. Methods: An online survey conducted with mothers and fathers in England who experienced a perinatal death. Participants reported how long ago their baby died and whether they/their partner subsequently became pregnant again. They were asked to rate their health on the EQ-5D-5L instrument (generic health measure). EQ-5D-5L responses were used to calculate health utility values. These were compared with age-matched values for the general population to estimate a utility shortfall (i.e. health loss) associated with perinatal death. Results: There were 256 survey respondents with a median age of 40 years (IQR 26–40). Median time since death was 27 months (IQR 8–71). The mean utility value of the sample was 0.774 (95% CI 0.752–0.796). Utility values in the sample were 13% lower than general population values (p < 0.05). Over 10 years, this equated to a loss of 1.1 QALYs. This reduction in health utility was driven by anxiety and depression.

All rights reserved.Background: Medical assistant (MA) roles have expanded rapidly as primary care has evolved and MAs take on new patient care duties. Research that looks at the MA experience and factors that enhance or reduce efficiency among MAs is limited. Methods: We surveyed all MAs working in 6 clinics run by a large academic family medicine department in Ann Arbor, Michigan. MAs deemed by peers as ""most efficient"" were selected for follow-up interviews. We evaluated personal strategies for efficiency, barriers to efficient care, impact of physician actions on efficiency, and satisfaction. Results: A total of 75/86 MAs (87%) responded to at least some survey questions and 61/86 (71%) completed the full survey. We interviewed 18 MAs face to face. Most saw their role as essential to clinic functioning and viewed health care as a personal calling. MAs identified common strategies to improve efficiency and described the MA role to orchestrate the flow of the clinic day. Staff recognized differing priorities of patients, staff, and physicians and articulated frustrations with hierarchy and competing priorities as well as behaviors that impeded clinic efficiency. Respondents emphasized the importance of feeling valued by others on their team. Conclusions: With the evolving demands made on MAs' time, it is critical to understand how the most effective staff members manage their role and highlight the strategies they employ to provide efficient clinical care.

We recruited recently bereaved mothers and asked them to participate in an existing online community for pregnancy and infant loss hosted on a commercial platform. Participants were asked to go online at least three times weekly for 6 weeks to read posts. Using a mixed-methods approach, we assessed attitudes toward online support, mental health, and experiences pre- A nd postintervention using written surveys and a brief phone interview. We used summary statistics for quantitative data and a deductive coding approach for qualitative data. Twenty participants completed the study. We found nonsignificant improvements in all four mental health domains (depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, moderate-severe generalized anxiety, and perinatal grief). Women reported the group allowed them to help others and feel less alone. They also reported that at times, posts could increase the intensity of their loss emotions. This study demonstrated feasibility to recruit, retain, and track participation in an online support group for perinatally-bereaved mothers of color.

Katherine Jo Gold,Online yoga to reduce post traumatic stress in women who have experienced stillbirth: a randomized control feasibility trial,2020.0,BMC complementary medicine and therapies,Article,Infant death; Mental health; Mindfulness; wWomen’s health; Infant death; Mental health; Mindfulness; wWomen’s health; Stillbirth,"BACKGROUND: About 1 in every 150 pregnancies end in stillbirth. Consequences include symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Yoga has been used to treat PTSD in other populations and may improve health outcomes for stillbirth mothers. The purpose of this study was to determine: (a) feasibility of a 12-week home-based, online yoga intervention with varying doses; (b) acceptability of a ""stretch and tone"" control group; and (c) preliminary efficacy of the intervention on reducing symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, perinatal grief, self-compassion, emotional regulation, mindfulness, sleep quality, and subjective health. METHODS: Participants (N = 90) were recruited nationally and randomized into one of three groups for yoga or exercise (low dose (LD), 60 min per week; moderate dose (MD), 150 min per week; and stretch-and-tone control group (STC)). Baseline and post-intervention surveys measured main outcomes (listed above). Frequency analyses were used to determine feasibility. Repeated measures ANCOVA were used to determine preliminary efficacy. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine a dose-response relationship between minutes of yoga and each outcome variable. RESULTS: Over half of participants completed the intervention (n = 48/90). Benchmarks (≥70% reported > 75% satisfaction) were met in each group for satisfaction and enjoyment. Participants meeting benchmarks (completing > 90% of prescribed minutes 9/12 weeks) for LD and MD groups were 44% (n = 8/18) and 6% (n = 1/16), respectively. LD and MD groups averaged 44.0 and 77.3 min per week of yoga, respectively. The MD group reported that 150 prescribed minutes per week of yoga was too much. There were significant decreases in PTSD and depression, and improvements in self-rated health at post-intervention for both intervention groups. There was a significant difference in depression scores (p = .036) and grief intensity (p = .009) between the MD and STC groups. PTSD showed non-significant decreases of 43% and 56% at post-intervention in LD and MD groups, respectively (22% decrease in control). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an online yoga intervention for women after stillbirth. Future research warrants a randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT02925481.

Katherine Jo Gold,Parents' experiences of care offered after stillbirth: An international online survey of high and middle-income countries,2021.0,Birth,Article,bereavement care; high-income countries; middle-income countries; parents; stillbirth; bereavement care; high-income countries; middle-income countries; parents; stillbirth,"2021 Wiley Periodicals LLCBackground: Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is associated with significant psychological and social consequences that can be mitigated by respectful and supportive bereavement care. The absence of high-level evidence to support the broad scope of perinatal bereavement practices means that offering a range of options identified as valued by parents has become an important indicator of care quality. This study aimed to describe bereavement care practices offered to parents across different high-income and middle-income countries. Methods: An online survey of parents of stillborn babies was conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. Frequencies of nine practices were compared between high-income and middle-income countries. Differences in proportions of reported practices and their associated odds ratios were calculated to compare high-income and middle-income countries. Results: Over three thousand parents (3041) with a self-reported stillbirth in the preceding five years from 40 countries responded. Fifteen countries had atleast 40 responses. Significant differences in the prevalence of offering nine bereavement care practices were reported by women in high-income countries (HICs) compared with women in middle-income countries (MICs). All nine practices were reported to occur significantly more frequently by women in HICs, including opportunity to see and hold their baby (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 4.0-5.9). The widespread occurrence of all nine practices was reported only for The Netherlands. Conclusions: Bereavement care after stillbirth varies between countries. Future research should look at why these differences occur, their impact on parents, and whether differences should be addressed, particularly how to support effective communication, decision-making, and follow-up care.",10.1111/birt.12546,La Trobe University,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,

This study sought to update data on physician suicides in the United States. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) at the Centers for Disease Control collects details about violent deaths. The study used 2010–2015 data from 27 NVDRS states to identify suicide deaths among physicians or non-physicians and calculate annual standardized mortality rates (SMR). Of 63,780 victims total, there were 357 physicians identified over 6 years, (307 men and 50 women). If results are extrapolated to all 50 states, there would be approximately 119 physician suicides annually. The SMR for physicians overall was not statistically different from that of non-physicians. This is the first study in 16 years to update estimated physician suicide rates in the United States. The research used strict criteria to identify physicians so results likely represent the lower boundary of physician suicides. Findings show that physician suicide is not significantly lower than that of non-physicians and emphasizes the importance of focusing on structural changes to reduce stigma around mental health in the medical community.",10.1080/13548506.2021.1903053,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,8359341.0

All rights reserved.Background: As the United States moves closer to a majority-minority, and a nearly equal male to female population, we should see a similar shift in the composition of leadership in the workplace. Family Medicine, while attempting to close the gaps, continues to fall short in producing women and minority leaders. Methods: The demographic traits of Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM) chairs in medical education institutions in the United States and Canada were analyzed. Results: The majority of those in chair positions were male (67%) and White (53%) non-Hispanic. Male chairs have been in positions significantly longer than females (average 9 years and 6 years, respectively). There was also a significant difference between chairs in public versus private schools-public, that is, chairs at public institutions had a much longer average time of 9 years in current position compared with those in private institutions had an average of 5 years. While the comparison was not significant, 46% of those that self-reported as non-White held chair positions at private schools compared with 28% of those that self-reported as White. Conclusions: Despite the availability of leadership pathways, women and underrepresented minorities continue to be underrepresented in these positions. Future research would benefit from a more extensive evaluation of different characteristics such as disability, gender identity and sexual orientation.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.05.220122,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,

Methods: A modified policy-Delphi methodology was used to consult international stakeholders and healthcare workers with experience in stillbirth between September 2017 and October 2018. Five sequential rounds involved two expert stakeholder meetings and three internet-based surveys, including a global internet-based survey targeted at healthcare workers in a wide range of settings. Results: Initially, 23 expert stakeholders considered 43 evidence-based themes derived from systematic reviews, identifying 10 core principles. The global survey received 236 responses from participants in 26 countries, after which nine principles met a priori criteria for inclusion. The final stakeholder meeting and internet-based survey of all participants confirmed consensus on eight core principles. Highest quality bereavement care should be enabled through training of healthcare staff to reduce stigma and establish respectful care, including acknowledgement and support for grief responses, and provision for physical and psychologic needs. Women and families should be supported to make informed choices, including those concerning their future reproductive health. Conclusion: Consensus was established for eight principles for stillbirth bereavement care. Further work should explore implementation and involve the voices of women and families globally.",10.1002/ijgo.13110,Bristol Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,8359341.0

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With the emergence of COVID-19, tele-medicine use has increased dramatically as clinicians and patients have looked for alternatives to face-to-face care. Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout. There was a high level of satisfaction at our institution despite multiple technical challenges.",10.22454/FamMed.2021.613099,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Positive psychology shows promise in improving positive affect and happiness. We tested a digital version of a positive psychology intervention called Three Good Things (3GT) among health care workers to assess whether gratitude practice improved well-being. METHODS All members of a large academic medicine department were invited. Participants were randomized to an immediate intervention group or control group (delayed intervention). Participants completed outcome measures surveys (demographics, depression, positive affect, gratitude, and life satisfaction) at baseline, and at 1 month and 3 months post-intervention. Controls completed additional surveys at 4 and 6 months (completion of the delayed intervention). During the intervention, we sent 3 text messages per week asking for 3GT that occurred that day. We used linear mixed models to compare the groups and to look at the effects of department role, sex, age, and time on outcomes. RESULTS Of 468 eligible individuals, 223 (48%) enrolled and were randomized with high retention through the end of the study. Most (87%) identified as female. For the intervention group, positive affect improved slightly at 1 month, then declined slightly but remained significantly improved at 3 months. Depression, gratitude, and life satisfaction scores showed a similar trend but were not statistically different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Our research showed adherence to a positive psychology intervention for health care workers created small positive improvements immediately post-intervention but were not sustained. Further work should evaluate whether utilizing different duration or intensity of the intervention improves benefits.",10.1370/afm.2963,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2639-0823,8276839400.0,
Katherine Jo Gold,Parents’ experiences of care offered after stillbirth: An international online survey of high and middle-income countries,2021.0,Birth,Article,bereavement care; high-income countries; middle-income countries; parents; stillbirth,"2021 Wiley Periodicals LLCBackground: Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is associated with significant psychological and social consequences that can be mitigated by respectful and supportive bereavement care. The absence of high-level evidence to support the broad scope of perinatal bereavement practices means that offering a range of options identified as valued by parents has become an important indicator of care quality. This study aimed to describe bereavement care practices offered to parents across different high-income and middle-income countries. Methods: An online survey of parents of stillborn babies was conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. Frequencies of nine practices were compared between high-income and middle-income countries. Differences in proportions of reported practices and their associated odds ratios were calculated to compare high-income and middle-income countries. Results: Over three thousand parents (3041) with a self-reported stillbirth in the preceding five years from 40 countries responded. Fifteen countries had atleast 40 responses. Significant differences in the prevalence of offering nine bereavement care practices were reported by women in high-income countries (HICs) compared with women in middle-income countries (MICs). All nine practices were reported to occur significantly more frequently by women in HICs, including opportunity to see and hold their baby (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 4.0-5.9). The widespread occurrence of all nine practices was reported only for The Netherlands. Conclusions: Bereavement care after stillbirth varies between countries. Future research should look at why these differences occur, their impact on parents, and whether differences should be addressed, particularly how to support effective communication, decision-making, and follow-up care.",10.1111/birt.12546,La Trobe University,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,

A virtual approach to evaluating musculoskeletal system ailments is particularly challenging, for diagnosis of these conditions generally rely greatly on physical examination, which may be challenging. However, a properly planned and executed telemedicine visit will yield successful results in most cases. Our aim is to produce a document with instructions and suggestions, including physical examination maneuvers, to help physicians carry out a proper virtual medical visit with patients complaining of ankle musculoskeletal problems. Virtual visits should not be thought of as a replacement for traditional face-to-face medical consultations, but rather a complementary method to provide health care when deemed appropriate.

Methods/Findings: We compared 27 artistic athletes (median age = 15.0 years; evaluated median = 13 days post-injury) and 49 ball sport athletes (median age = 15.3 years; evaluated median = 10 days post-injury) within 21 days of sustaining a concussion on measures of symptom profiles and postural control (Balance Error Scoring System [BESS]), tandem gait, and Romberg tests. After adjusting for the independent effect of time from injury-evaluation, concussion history, and pre-morbid migraine history, we observed that artistic athletes performed the BESS tandem stance foam condition with fewer errors than ball sport athletes (β = −2.4; 95% CI = −4.7, −0.2; p = .03). Artistic athletes demonstrated a higher, yet not statistically significant, headache severity than ball sport athletes (median = 4.5 vs 4.0, p = .07). Conclusions: Overall, artistic athletes had similar symptom profiles to ball sport athletes. Postural control measures, other than the BESS tandem stance foam condition, were not significantly different from ball sport athletes. This suggests that although their sports may require higher levels of balance, artistic athletes’ performance on post-concussion balance tests may be similar to athletes of other disciplines.",10.1080/02699052.2020.1763464,University of Colorado School of Medicine,,56041883200.0,

It is a complex disorder with a variety of manifestations and symptom dimensions, some of which are underrecognized. Early recognition and treatment with OCD-specific therapies may improve outcomes, but there is often a delay in diagnosis. Patients can experience significant improvement with treatment, and some may achieve remission. Recommended first-line therapies are cognitive behavior therapy, specifically exposure and response prevention, and/or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Patients with OCD require higher SSRI dosages than for other indications, and the treatment response time is typically longer. When effective, long-term treatment with an SSRI is a reasonable option to prevent relapse. Patients with severe symptoms or lack of response to first-line therapies should be referred to a psychiatrist. There are a variety of options for treatment-resistant OCD, including clomipramine or augmenting an SSRI with an atypical antipsychotic. Patients with OCD should be closely monitored for psychiatric comorbidities and suicidal ideation.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,56957718200.0,

Methods Women ≤28 weeks gestation were enrolled from obstetric clinics in Rochester, NY and followed through their delivery. CPD parameters included total cholesterol, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), high sensitivity-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index at <14 weeks gestation, glucose tolerance, and urinary albumin collected in the third trimester. Linear regression was used to estimate the association between physiologic dysfunction and birth weight and gestational age, respectively (N = 111). Results CPD scores ranged from 0 to 6, out of a total of 8 parameters (Mean 2.09; SD = 1.42). Three-fourths of the participants had a CPD score of 3.0 or lower. The mean birth weight was 3397 g (SD = 522.89), and the mean gestational age was 39.64 weeks (SD = 1.08). CPD was not significantly associated with either birth weight or gestational age (p = 0.42 and p = 0.44, respectively).

Based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) acute stress disorder symptom criteria, the PTSS is designed for adolescent (13–21 years) and adult self-report and caregiver-report on 3–12-year-olds. To evaluate psychometric properties, we used PTSS data collected between April 2020 and August 2021 from non-pregnant adult caregivers (n = 11,483), pregnant/postpartum individuals (n = 1,656), adolescents (n = 1,795), and caregivers reporting on 3–12-year-olds (n = 2,896). We used Mokken scale analysis to examine unidimensionality and reliability, Pearson correlations to evaluate relationships with other relevant variables, and analyses of variance to identify regional, age, and sex differences. Mokken analysis resulted in a moderately strong, unidimensional scale that retained nine of the original 10 items. We detected small to moderate positive associations with depression, anxiety, and general stress, and negative associations with life satisfaction. Adult caregivers had the highest PTSS scores, followed by adolescents, pregnant/postpartum individuals, and children.

Kimberly Mckee,Edinburgh postpartum depression scores are associated with vaginal and gut microbiota in pregnancy,2025.0,Journal of Affective Disorders,Article,Depression; Gut; Mental health; Microbiome; Pregnancy; Vaginal; Depression; Gut; Mental health; Microbiome; Pregnancy; Vaginal,"2024 The AuthorsBackground: Prenatal and postpartum depression may be influenced by the composition of host associated microbiomes. As such, the objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the human gut or vaginal microbiomes in pregnancy with prenatal or postpartum depression. Methods: 140 female participants were recruited at their first prenatal visit and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to screen for depression and anxiety, in addition the EPDS was completed one month postpartum. Vaginal and stool biospecimens were collected in the third trimester, analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and assessed for alpha and beta diversity. Individual taxa differences and clustering using the k-medoids algorithm enabled community state type classification. Results: Participants with higher postpartum EPDS scores had higher species richness and lower abundance of L. crispatus in the vaginal microbiota compared to those with lower EPDS scores. Participants with a higher prenatal EPDS score had lower species richness of the gut microbiome. Participants with a vaginal community state type dominated by L. iners had the highest mean prenatal EPDS scores, whereas postpartum EPDS scores were similar regardless of prenatal vaginal state type. Limitations: Our small sample size and participant's self-report bias limits generalizability of results. Conclusions: Depression in the prenatal and postpartum period is associated with the composition and diversity of the gut and vaginal microbiomes in the third trimester of pregnancy. These results provide a foundational understanding of the microbial relationships between maternal health and depression for identifying potential therapeutic treatments.",10.1016/j.jad.2024.10.086,College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

We evaluated the association between past environmental exposures and the presence of vulvodynia. Materials and Methods: The history of 28 lifetime environmental exposures was queried in the longitudinal population-based Woman-to-Woman Health Study on the 24-month follow-up survey. Relationships between these and vulvodynia case status were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Overall, 1585 women completed the 24-month survey, the required covariate responses, and questions required for case status assessment. Screening positive as a vulvodynia case was associated with history of exposures to home-sprayed chemicals (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides - odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71-3.58, p < 0.0001), home rodent poison and mothballs (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25-2.09, p < 0.001), working with solvents and paints (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.68-3.70, p < 0.0001), working as a housekeeper/maid (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.42-3.00, p < 0.0001), working as a manicurist/hairdresser (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14-3.53, p < 0.05), and working at a dry cleaning facility (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.08-4.19, p < 0.05). When classified into nine individual environmental exposure categories and all included in the same model, significant associations remained for four categories (home-sprayed chemicals, home rodent poison or mothballs, paints and solvents, and working as a housekeeper). Conclusions: This preliminary evaluation suggests a positive association between vulvodynia and the reported history of exposures to a number of household and work-related environmental toxins. Further investigation of timing and dose of environmental exposures, relationship to clinical course, and treatment outcomes is warranted.",10.1089/jwh.2018.7188,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

Using PERMANOVA models, we assessed factors associated with vaginal community structure in pregnancy, examined whether host factors were conserved across populations, and tested the independent and combined effects of host factors on vaginal community state types (CSTs) using multinomial logistic regression models. Demographic and social factors explained a larger amount of variation in the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy than clinical factors. After adjustment, lower education, rather than self-identified race, remained a robust predictor of L. iners dominant (CST III) and diverse (CST IV) (OR = 8.44, 95% CI = 4.06–17.6 and OR = 4.18, 95% CI = 1.88–9.26, respectively). In random forest models, we identified specific taxonomic features of host factors, particularly urogenital pathogens associated with pregnancy complications (Aerococcus christensenii and Gardnerella spp.) among other facultative anaerobes and key markers of community instability (L. iners).

This study used a quasi-experimental design to account for potential confounding by sociodemographic characteristics. Methods Data were drawn from 16 prenatal cohorts participating in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. Women exposed to the pandemic (delivered between 12 March 2020 and 30 May 2021) (n = 501) were propensity-score matched on maternal age, race and ethnicity, and child assigned sex at birth with 501 women who delivered before 11 March 2020. Participants reported on perceived stress, depressive symptoms, sedentary behavior, and emotional support during pregnancy. Infant gestational age (GA) at birth and birthweight were gathered from medical record abstraction or maternal report. Results After adjusting for propensity matching and covariates (maternal education, public assistance, employment status, prepregnancy body mass index), results showed a small effect of pandemic exposure on shorter GA at birth, but no effect on birthweight adjusted for GA. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic reported higher levels of prenatal stress and depressive symptoms, but neither mediated the association between pandemic exposure and GA. Sedentary behavior and emotional support were each associated with prenatal stress and depressive symptoms in opposite directions, but no moderation effects were revealed. Conclusions There was no strong evidence for an association between pandemic exposure and adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, results highlight the importance of reducing maternal sedentary behavior and encouraging emotional support for optimizing maternal health regardless of pandemic conditions.",10.1017/S0033291723000314,University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

All rights reserved.Objective: We sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal outcomes while accounting for maternal depression or perceived stress and to describe COVID-specific stressors, including changes in prenatal care, across specifc time periods of the pandemic. Study Design: Data dyads from 41 cohorts from the National Institutes of Health Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program (N=2983) were used to compare birth outcomes before and during the pandemic (n= 2355), and a partially overlapping sample (n=1490) responded to a COVID-19 questionnaire. Psychosocial stress was defined using prenatal screening for depression and perceived stress. Propensity-score matching and general estimating equations with robust variance estimation were used to estimate the pandemic's effect on birth outcomes. Results: Symptoms of depression and perceived stress during pregnancy were similar prior to and during the pandemic, with nearly 40% of participants reporting mild to severe stress, and 24% reporting mild depression to severe depression. Gestations were shorter during the pandemic (B=-0.33 weeks, p=0.025), and depression was significantly associated with shortened gestation (B=-0.02 weeks, p=0.015) after adjustment. Birth weights were similar (B=-28.14 g, p=0.568), but infants born during the pandemic had slightly larger birth weights for gestational age at delivery than those born before the pandemic (B=0.15 z-score units, p=0.041). More women who gave birth early in the pandemic reported being moderately or extremely distressed about changes to their prenatal care and delivery (45%) compared with those who delivered later in the pandemic. A majority (72%) reported somewhat to extremely negative views of COVID-19 on their life. Conclusions: In this national cohort, we detected no efect of COVID-19 on prenatal depression or perceived stress.

The prevalence of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and serious mental illness from 2006 to 2015 were estimated as well as associated risk of adverse obstetric outcomes, including severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM), and delivery costs. Methods: The study was a serial, cross-sectional analysis of National Inpatient Sample data. The prevalence of PMAD and SMI was estimated among delivering women as well as obstetric outcomes, healthcare utilization, and delivery costs using adjusted weighted logistic with predictive margins and generalized linear regression models, respectively. Results: The study included an estimated 39,025,974 delivery hospitalizations from 2006 to 2015 in the U.S. PMAD increased from 18.4 (95% CI 16.4-20.0) to 40.4 (95% CI 39.3-41.6) per 1000 deliveries.

Kimberly Mckee,State breastfeeding worksite statutes..Breastfeeding rates..and,2011.0,Breastfeeding Medicine,Article,"comparing breastfeeding, breastfeeding statute, breastfeeding, breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding statutes, statutes breastfeeding, breastfeeding worksite, breastfeeding duration, state breastfeeding","Background: State worksite breastfeeding statutes are thought to play a role in increasing rates of breastfeeding duration, which remain below Healthy People 2010 goals. As of 2010 24 states including the District of Columbia had such worksite statutes. Of these only 18 required both break time and a site. This preliminary analysis assessed if infants born in states with worksite breastfeeding statutes had longer breastfeeding duration. Methods: Using the 2009 National Immunization Survey we analyzed infants comparing breastfeeding duration at 6 months with type of worksite breastfeeding statute in place, while adjusting for year enacted and other state characteristics (years since founding of state breastfeeding coalition, breastfeeding supportive hospital practices). Other covariates included maternal and infant characteristics. Only those infants whose mothers were at least 18 years old and who had not changed state of residence since birth were included (n=16,145). Results: Although requiring a site and/or break time for breastfeeding increased the likelihood of breastfeeding at 6 months (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.35; p=0.002), after accounting for other factors this relationship remained positive but was not significant (adjusted odd ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.24). Because all mothers, not just those in or returning to the workforce, were included in the analysis this relationship could be underestimated. Breastfeeding at 6 months was associated with being from a state that had had a breastfeeding coalition for a longer period of time (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.49; p<0001). Conclusions: State worksite breastfeeding statutes alone may not directly affect breastfeeding duration. Analysis of breastfeeding duration using the multiple levels of the social-ecological model is a potentially useful approach to understanding the impact of state breastfeeding statutes. The impact of state breastfeeding coalitions warrants further study. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",10.1089/bfm.2011.0082,University of Rochester,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

Thieme. All rights reserved.Objective Hearing loss is increasingly prevalent among younger adults, impacting health and health care use. Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) women have a higher risk of chronic diseases, pregnancy complications, and adverse birth outcomes compared with hearing women. Health care utilization patterns during the perinatal period remain not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine differences in antenatal emergency department and inpatient utilization among DHH and non-DHH women. Study Design We conducted a retrospective cohort study design to analyze 2002 to 2013 Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal data to compare antenatal inpatient and emergency department use between DHH (N = 925) and hearing (N = 2,895) women with singleton deliveries. Matching was done based on delivery year, age at delivery, and birth parity in 1:3 case-control ratio. Demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and hospital characteristics were first compared for DHH mothers and the matched control group using chi-squared tests and t -tests. Multivariable models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Results Among DHH women (N = 925), 49% had at least one emergency department visit, 19% had an observational stay, and 14% had a nondelivery hospital stay compared with 26, 14, and 6%, respectively, among hearing women (N = 28,95) during the antenatal period (all p s < 0.001). The risk of nondelivery emergency department visits (risk ratio [RR] 1.58; p < 0.001) and inpatient stays (RR = 1.89; p < 0.001) remained higher among DHH women compared with hearing women even after adjustment. Having four or more antenatal emergency department visits (7 vs. 2%) and two or more nondelivery hospital stays (4 vs. 0.4%) were more common among pregnant DHH women compared with their controls (all p -values < 0.001). Conclusion The findings demonstrate that DHH women use emergency departments and inpatient services at a significantly higher rate than their hearing controls during the antenatal period. A systematic investigation of the mechanisms for these findings are needed. Key Points Antenatal emergency department use is significantly higher among deaf and hard of hearing women. Antenatal hospitalizations are significantly higher among deaf and hard of hearing women. Hearing loss screening may identify those at risk for adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.",10.1055/a-2053-7439,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,54383802700.0,

This study compared rates of SMM during delivery and postpartum among DHH and non-DHH women. Methods: This nationally representative retrospective cohort study used hospital discharge data from the 2004–2020 Health Care and Cost Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The risk of SMM with and without blood transfusion during delivery and postpartum among DHH and non-DHH women were compared using modified Poisson regression analysis. The study was conducted in the United States in 2022–2023. Results: The cohort included 9351 births to DHH women for the study period, and 13,574,382 age-matched and delivery year-matched births to non-DHH women in a 1:3 case-control ratio. The main outcomes were SMM and non-transfusion SMM during delivery and postpartum. Relative risks were sequentially adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, hospital-level characteristics, and clinical characteristics. In unadjusted analyses, DHH women were at 80% higher risk for SMM (RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.63–2.02, p < 0.001) during delivery and postpartum compared to non-DHH women. Adjustment for socio-demographic and hospital characteristics attenuated risk for SMM (RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.38–1.72, p < 0.001). Adjustment for the Elixhauser comorbidity score further attenuated the risk of SMM among DHH women (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.26, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate a critical need for inclusive preconception, prenatal, and postpartum care that address conditions that increase the risk for SMM among DHH people.",10.1016/j.ypmed.2024.107883,Brandeis University,0000-0002-5561-9885,54383802700.0,

However, little is known about postpartum outcomes among DHH women. The objective was to compare the risk of postpartum hospitalizations for DHH compared with non-DHH women and the leading indications for postpartum admissions. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the 1998-2017 Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal Data System and identified 3,546 singleton deliveries to DHH women and 1,381,439 singleton deliveries to non-DHH women. We used Cox proportional hazard models to compare the first hospital admission and ≥2 hospital admissions between DHH and non-DHH women within 1-42, 43-90, and 91-365 days after delivery. Results: DHH women had a higher risk for any hospital admissions across all periods (hazard ratios [HR] = 1.84; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.46-2.34 within 1-42 days; HR = 2.76; 95%CI 1.99-3.83 within 43-90 days; and HR = 3.10; 95%CI 2.66-3.60 91-365 days) after childbirth compared with non-DHH women. They had an almost seven times higher risk for repeated hospital admissions within 43-90 days (HR = 6.84; 95%CI 1.66-28.21) and nearly four times higher the risk within 91-365 days (HR = 3.63; 95%CI 2.00-6.59) after delivery compared with non-DHH women. The leading indications for readmission among DHH women included: conditions complicating the puerperium/hemorrhage and soft tissues disorders. Conclusion: Compared with other women, DHH women had significantly higher readmissions across all postpartum periods and for repeated admissions >42 days.

We calculated contraceptive care quality measures, per the U.S. Office of Population Health, as the percentage of enrollees who used: 1) LARC methods or 2) most effective or moderately effective methods (tubal sterilization, pills, patch, ring, injectables, or diaphragm).RESULTS:We identified 1,171,838 enrollees at risk for pregnancy; 13,400 (1.1%) were deaf or hard of hearing. Among individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing, 31.4% were provided contraception (23.5% prescription contraception, 5.4% LARC, 0.7% tubal sterilization). Individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing were less likely to receive prescription contraception (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96) than individuals who were not deaf or hard of hearing. The percentage of individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing who received most effective or moderately effective methods was less than that for individuals who were not (24.2% vs 26.3%, P<.001). There were no differences in provision of LARC or permanent contraception by deaf and hard-of-hearing status.CONCLUSION:Individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing were less likely to receive prescription contraception than individuals who were not; factors underlying this pattern need to be examined. Provision of LARC or permanent contraception did not differ by deaf or hard-of-hearing status. These findings should be monitored and compared with data from states with different requirements for contraceptive coverage.",10.1097/AOG.0000000000004505,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,54383802700.0,

Until recently, there were no U.S. population-based studies of pregnancy outcomes among deaf or hard of hearing women. In light of inconsistent findings in the limited available literature, this study sought to conduct a more rigorous study using population-based, longitudinal linked data to compare pregnancy complications, birth characteristics, and neonatal outcomes between deaf or hard of hearing and non-deaf or hard of hearing women. Methods: Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study in 2019 using the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal data system. This system links all Massachusetts birth certificates, fetal death reports, and delivery- and nondelivery-related hospital discharge records for all infants and their mothers. The study included women with singleton deliveries who gave birth in Massachusetts between January 1998 and December 2013. Results: The deaf or hard of hearing women had an increased risk of chronic medical conditions and pregnancy complications including pre-existing diabetes, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and placental abruption. Deliveries to deaf or hard of hearing women were significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight or very low weight, and low 1-minute Apgar score or low 5-minute Apgar score. No significant differences were found in size for gestational age, fetal distress, or stillbirth among deaf or hard of hearing women. Conclusions: Findings from this 2019 study indicate that deaf or hard of hearing women are at a heightened risk for chronic conditions, pregnancy-related complications, and adverse birth outcomes and underscore the need for systematic investigation of the pregnancy- and neonatal-related risks, complications, costs, mechanisms, and outcomes of deaf or hard of hearing women.",10.1016/j.amepre.2019.10.012,Brandeis University,0000-0002-5561-9885,54383802700.0,
Kimberly Mckee,"Knowledge, Behaviors, and Social Factors That Influence Pregnancy Weight Gain among Youth Ages 16-24 Years",2020.0,Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology,Article,Adolescent; Gestational weight gain; Healthy behaviors; Pregnancy; Pregnancy weight gain; Pregnant; Teen; Text messaging; Weight gain; Youth,"2020 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent GynecologyStudy Objective: A large proportion (50%-75%) of youth (younger than 21 years old) who become pregnant gain more weight during pregnancy than is recommended by the National Academy of Medicine. Excess weight gain during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for long-term obesity among mothers and their infants. There is a significant gap in our understanding of youth's knowledge and behavior related to weight gain during pregnancy. To develop effective interventions for pregnant youth, it is necessary to understand their distinct needs and preferences. Using a youth-centered qualitative approach, the purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge, behaviors, and social factors that influence weight gain during pregnancy for youth. Design: Participants completed weekly text message surveys and semistructured interviews to explore their perspectives of weight gain during pregnancy. Data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis on the basis of grounded theory. Setting and Participants: Pregnant youth ages 16-24 years old recruited from 2 urban, low-income, primary care clinics in Southeast Michigan. Interventions, Main Outcome Measures, and Results: Among our sample (N = 54) 4 themes emerged. First, many youths were knowledgeable about healthy behaviors in pregnancy. However, the second theme showed that many youths reported barriers to engaging in these healthy behaviors, including stress, poor motivation, and issues of convenience. Third, they showed inadequate knowledge about exercise in pregnancy, and fourth, many endorsed food cravings that significantly influenced diet choices. Conclusion: Many pregnant youths have appropriate knowledge about healthy behaviors during pregnancy, but face many youth-specific barriers to achieving these behaviors. Interventions should address logistical challenges (eg, food access, cost, transportation) to healthy behaviors in pregnancy to make healthy diet and exercise more convenient for pregnant youth.",10.1016/j.jpag.2019.10.001,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,54383802700.0,
Kimberly Mckee,Use of Reversible Contraceptive Methods Among U.S. Women with Physical or Sensory Disabilities,2017.0,Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health,Article,"disabilities risk, contraceptive use, contraceptive, sensory disabilities, contraceptive methods, disabilities, women disabilities, disability, contraceptive disparities, reversible contraceptive","Copyright © 2017 by the Guttmacher InstituteCONTEXT: Women with disabilities experience a higher rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes than women without disabilities. Preventing or delaying pregnancy when that is the best choice for a woman is a critical strategy to reducing pregnancy-related disparities, yet little is known about current contraceptive use among women with disabilities. METHODS: A cohort of 545 reproductive-age women with physical disabilities (i.e., difficulty walking, climbing, dressing or bathing) or sensory disabilities (i.e., difficulty with vision or hearing) was identified from among participants in the 2011–2013 National Survey of Family Growth. Those at risk for unplanned pregnancy were categorized by whether they were using highly effective reversible contraceptive methods (IUD, implant), moderately effective ones (pill, patch, ring, injectable), less effective ones (condoms, withdrawal, spermicides, diaphragm, natural family planning) or no method. Multinomial regression was conducted to examine the association between disability and type of contraceptive used. RESULTS: Some 39% of women with disabilities were at risk of unplanned pregnancy, and 27% of those at risk were not using contraceptives. The presence of disability was associated with decreased odds of using highly effective methods or moderately effective methods, rather than less effective ones (odds ratio, 0.6 for each), but had no association with using no method. CONCLUSION: There is a significant need to reduce contraceptive disparities related to physical or sensory disabilities. Future research should explore the extent to which contraceptive use differs by type and severity of disability, as well as identify contextual factors that contribute to any identified differences.",10.1363/psrh.12031,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-5561-9885,54383802700.0,
Kimberly Mckee,Female sterilization is more common among women with physical and/or sensory disabilities than women without disabilities in the United States,2017.0,Disability and Health Journal,Article,Female sterilization; National Survey of Family Growth; Physical disability; Sensory disability; Women with disabilities,"2016 Elsevier Inc.Background Female sterilization accounts for 50% of all contraceptive use in the U.S. The extent to which U.S. women with physical and/or sensory disabilities have undergone female sterilization is unknown. Objective Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of sterilization for women with physical/sensory disabilities, and compare this to the prevalence for women without disabilities. We also compared use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods between women with and without disabilities. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth 2011–2013, a population-based survey of U.S. women aged 15–44. Bivariate comparisons between women with and without disabilities by female sterilization and LARC use were conducted using chi-square tests. Using logistic regression, we estimated the odds of female sterilization based upon disability status. Results Women with physical/sensory disabilities accounted for 9.3% of the total sample (N = 4966). Among women with disabilities only, 28.2% had undergone female sterilization, representing 1.2 million women nationally. LARC use was lower among women with disabilities than those without disabilities (5.4%, 9.3%, respectively, p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, insurance, marital status, parity, and self-reported health, women with disabilities had higher odds of sterilization (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03, 1.79). Conclusions The odds of female sterilization is higher among women with physical/sensory disabilities than those without disabilities. Future research is necessary to understand factors contributing to this finding, including possible underutilization of LARC methods.",10.1016/j.dhjo.2016.12.020,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,54383802700.0,
Kimberly Mckee,Higher educational attainment but not higher income is protective for cardiovascular risk in Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users,2014.0,Disability and Health Journal,Conference Paper,Cardiovascular health; Deaf; Education; Health disparities; Income,"Background Higher educational attainment and income provide cardiovascular protection in the general population. It is unknown if the same effect is seen among Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users who face communication barriers in health care settings. Objective We sought to examine whether educational attainment and/or annual household income were inversely associated with cardiovascular risk in a sample of Deaf ASL users. Methods This cross-sectional study included 302 Deaf respondents aged 18-88 years from the Deaf Health Survey (2008), an adapted and translated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) administered in sign language. Associations between the self-reported cardiovascular disease equivalents (CVDE; any of the following: diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular attack (CVA), and angina) with educational attainment (≤high school [low education], some college, and ≥4 year college degree [referent]), and annual household income (<$25,000, $25,000-<$50,000, or ≥$50,000 [referent]) were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking history. Results Deaf respondents who reported ≤high school education were more likely to report the presence of a CVDE (OR = 5.76; 95% CI = 2.04-16.31) compared to Deaf respondents who reported having ≥4 year college degree after adjustment. However, low-income Deaf individuals (i.e., household incomes <$25,000) were not more likely to report the presence of a CVDE (OR = 2.24; 95% CI = 0.76-6.68) compared to high-income Deaf respondents after adjustment. Conclusion Low educational attainment was associated with higher likelihood of reported cardiovascular equivalents among Deaf individuals. Higher income did not appear to provide a cardiovascular protective effect for Deaf respondents. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Kimberly Mckee,State breastfeeding worksite statutes..Breastfeeding rates..and...,2011.0,Breastfeeding Medicine,Article,"comparing breastfeeding, breastfeeding statute, breastfeeding, breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding statutes, statutes breastfeeding, breastfeeding worksite, breastfeeding duration, state breastfeeding","Background: State worksite breastfeeding statutes are thought to play a role in increasing rates of breastfeeding duration, which remain below Healthy People 2010 goals. As of 2010 24 states including the District of Columbia had such worksite statutes. Of these only 18 required both break time and a site. This preliminary analysis assessed if infants born in states with worksite breastfeeding statutes had longer breastfeeding duration. Methods: Using the 2009 National Immunization Survey we analyzed infants comparing breastfeeding duration at 6 months with type of worksite breastfeeding statute in place, while adjusting for year enacted and other state characteristics (years since founding of state breastfeeding coalition, breastfeeding supportive hospital practices). Other covariates included maternal and infant characteristics. Only those infants whose mothers were at least 18 years old and who had not changed state of residence since birth were included (n=16,145). Results: Although requiring a site and/or break time for breastfeeding increased the likelihood of breastfeeding at 6 months (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.35; p=0.002), after accounting for other factors this relationship remained positive but was not significant (adjusted odd ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.24). Because all mothers, not just those in or returning to the workforce, were included in the analysis this relationship could be underestimated. Breastfeeding at 6 months was associated with being from a state that had had a breastfeeding coalition for a longer period of time (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.49; p<0001). Conclusions: State worksite breastfeeding statutes alone may not directly affect breastfeeding duration. Analysis of breastfeeding duration using the multiple levels of the social-ecological model is a potentially useful approach to understanding the impact of state breastfeeding statutes. The impact of state breastfeeding coalitions warrants further study. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",10.1089/bfm.2011.0082,University of Rochester,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5817-7077,58742607100.0,

All rights reserved.Objective: Patients taking antiresorptive medications in dental clinics are at risk of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), which poses daily challenges for their clinicians. This paper aimed to summarize and revisit the three most recognized practice guidelines for the management and prevention of MRONJ, which were proposed by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), and presented by the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (JBMR) and the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO). Results and case studies: The AAOMS position paper focused on risk stratification by different medications, management decision trees, risk factors, pathophysiology, and disease staging. The JBMR international consensus presented eight focused questions, which were addressed by systematic reviews. The JCO clinical practice guideline presented six clinical questions, and each concluded with practical recommendations. Practical information was summarized and converted into an adoptable patient care workflow for clinicians to follow and apply in daily practice. Three case studies presented were treated following these guidelines. Each patient underwent advanced surgeries including alveoloplasty, tooth extraction, implant placement, and particulate bone grafting. Some of the considerations not fully informed were discussed and illustrated in each step of the patient care workflow, which included specifics for risk communication, updates on the use of antibiotics, biomarkers, and drug holidays. Conclusion and practical implications: Structured risk communication with official informed consent documentation should be considered before initiating invasive treatments. Disease control phase with home care therapy should be provided prior to staged reconstructive therapy. Drug holidays and antibiotics coverage can be customized based on individual conditions and related procedures with interprofessional coordination.",10.3290/j.qi.b4213007,University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine,0000-0001-5817-7077,58742607100.0,

New interns typically learn the sterile cervical exam on the job by examining women in labor. This can be uncomfortable for patients and may increase the risk of infection. Simulated training could minimize these challenges, but manufactured models are expensive and not widely available in residency programs. We sought to evaluate a simple, homemade sewn model using stretchy fabric and pipe cleaners that could improve teaching and acquisition of cervical examination skills and common obstetrical procedures. Methods: We used the model to teach cervical examination skills to students and new interns and assessed participant satisfaction. We evaluated examination accuracy by grading practice exams on the model before and after a workshop teaching obstetrical procedures including the sterile vaginal exam. We calculated satisfaction using summary statistics. We evaluated pre-and postscores for exam accuracy using paired t tests. Results: Interns demonstrated a significant improvement in cervical exam skills using the model, and participants reported very high satisfaction with the workshop utilizing the model. Conclusions: We developed a simple, low-cost cervical exam model that was shown to be well-regarded by trainees and could be duplicated by other residency programs. This approach provides a unique and accessible way to offer hands-on simulation during obstetrical training. The model may improve trainees’ understanding of the procedures which would lead to better experiences for obstetrical patients.",10.22454/FamMed.55.284433,University of Michigan Medical School,,57189959124.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine residency recruitment has been a requested transition to virtual interviewing by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the academic family medicine community. This has led to creative and adaptive approaches to virtual interviewing with little previous knowledge, experience, or processes. This work describes the impact of transitioning to virtual recruitment on applicants’ reported experiences and factors influencing decision-making with family medicine at a large research university. METHODS: We made a comparison of 2 years of in-person interview day surveys with 2 years of virtual interview surveys following transition to virtual recruitment. We tested differences between in-person and virtual interviews for significance using χ2 tests. RESULTS: There were significant differences in factors influencing a candi-date’s decision to apply. Candidates who participated in virtual interviews were more interested in urban training settings, a community setting, and obstetrical training compared with the in-person interview cohort. Nearly 50% of virtual candidates reported preferring virtual interviews in the future. There were no significant differences in how candidates rated their experience of the interview process and they indicated adequate contact with resident per-sonnel despite a transition to virtual interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to virtual recruitment has been well received by candidates, as indicated by the high positive ratings of the cohorts. The transition has not resulted in a negative impact on the recruitment experience or the ability to meet with resident leadership.",10.22454/fammed.2022.510274,Michigan Medicine,,57189959124.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: Rights and access for transgender individuals, including the participation of transgender athletes in sports, have long been debated. These discussions often center around fairness and mental health impacts on youths associated with identity-based inclusion in sports. Objective: To assess the experiences and perspectives of adolescents and young adults on the inclusion of transgender individuals in competitive sports. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, 5 open-ended survey questions were sent to the MyVoice cohort from December 10 to 17, 2021. MyVoice is a nationwide text-message polling platform of US youths aged 14 to 24 years. All coding and subsequent analysis was completed between January 10 and December 11, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Qualitative perspectives of youths regarding transgender athlete participation in sports as measured by survey responses. Responses were reviewed using an inductive approach to qualitative thematic analysis to develop a codebook. The codes were independently applied to all responses by 2 investigators; discrepancies were resolved with discussion. Summary statistics were calculated for demographic characteristics and code frequencies, and χ2 tests (α =.05, 2-tailed) were used to evaluate differences in opinion based on gender identity and participation in competitive sports. Results: A total of 905 of 1199 youths (75%) responded to the survey. Respondents had a mean (SD) age of 20 (2) years; 482 (53%) identified as male, 29 (3%) identified as transgender, and 306 (34%) reported having participated in high school and/or collegiate athletics. Three themes emerged: (1) youths differed regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes based on gender identity vs sex assigned at birth, (2) many youths did not have personal experience related to the inclusion of transgender athletes, and (3) youths were uncertain about the impacts of gender identity-based participation on cisgender individuals but perceived positive impacts for transgender individuals. Nearly half of respondents (327 of 691 [47%]) thought that transgender athletes should participate based on their gender identity or personal preference, whereas 240 (35%) favored participation based on sex assigned at birth or in a transgender-only category. Respondents mentioned concern about the fairness of identity-based participation, specifically for cisgender women, but many (410 of 697 [59%]) also reported that it would be affirming for transgender athletes to participate based on gender identity. Conclusions and Relevance: The youths in our study differed in their opinions regarding sports participation of transgender youths, but many felt that inclusive policies would affirm and support the mental health of transgender individuals. Negative impacts on fairness were noted by some respondents. These findings suggest that nuanced policies are needed to address the participation of transgender athletes in competitive sports and should consider the impacts on and perspectives of youths most affected..",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.55107,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",,57221272562.0,

Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.The COVID-19 outbreak has sown clinical and administrative chaos at academic health centers throughout the country. As COVID-19-related burdens on the health care system and medical schools piled up, questions from medical students far outweighed the capacity of medical school administrators to respond in an adequate or timely manner, leaving students feeling confused and without clear guidance. In this article, incoming and outgoing executive leaders of the University of Michigan Medical School Student Council and medical school deans outline the specific ways they were able to bridge the gap between medical students and administrators in a time of crisis. To illustrate the value of student government during uncertain times, the authors identify the most pressing problems faced by students at each phase of the curriculum - preclerkship, clerkship, and postclerkship - and explain how Student Council leadership partnered with administrators to find creative solutions to these problems and provide guidance to learners. They end by reflecting on the role of student government more broadly, identifying 3 guiding principles of student leadership and how these principles enable effective student representation.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000003542,University of Michigan Medical School,,57221272562.0,

Published by Cambridge University Press.Background: Primary care providers (PCPs) are expected to help patients with obesity to lose weight through behavior change counseling and patient-centered use of available weight management resources. Yet, many PCPs face knowledge gaps and clinical time constraints that hinder their ability to successfully support patients' weight loss. Fortunately, a small and growing number of physicians are now certified in obesity medicine through the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) and can provide personalized and effective obesity treatment to individual patients. Little is known, however, about how to extend the expertise of ABOM-certified physicians to support PCPs and their many patients with obesity. Aim: To develop and pilot test an innovative care model-the Weight Navigation Program (WNP)-to integrate ABOM-certified physicians into primary care settings and to enhance the delivery of personalized, effective obesity care. Methods: Quality improvement program with an embedded, 12-month, single-arm pilot study. Patients with obesity and ≥1 weight-related co-morbidity may be referred to the WNP by PCPs. All patients seen within the WNP during the first 12 months of clinical operations will be compared to a matched cohort of patients from another primary care site. We will recruit a subset of WNP patients (n = 30) to participate in a remote weight monitoring pilot program, which will include surveys at 0, 6, and 12 months, qualitative interviews at 0 and 6 months, and use of an electronic health record (EHR)-based text messaging program for remote weight monitoring. Discussion: Obesity is a complex chronic condition that requires evidence-based, personalized, and longitudinal care. To deliver such care in general practice, the WNP leverages the expertise of ABOM-certified physicians, health system and community weight management resources, and EHR-based population health management tools. The WNP is an innovative model with the potential to be implemented, scaled, and sustained in diverse primary care settings.",10.1017/S1463423621000906,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0001-9594-4116,55588124800.0,

All rights reserved.Background: People with low income are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17.6% of US adults with T2D experience food insecurity and low diet quality. Low-carbohydrate eating plans can improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and are associated with improved cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality. Little is known about supporting low-carbohydrate eating for people with T2D, although food-as-medicine interventions paired with nutrition education offer a promising solution. Objective: This program aims to support the initiation of dietary changes by using grocery delivery and low-carbohydrate education to increase the quality of low-carbohydrate nutrition among people with T2D and food insecurity. Methods: This program was a nonrandomized pilot conducted at 21 primary care practices in Michigan. Adults with T2D and food insecurity or low income were eligible to enroll. Patients were referred by primary care clinic staff. All participants received the 3-month program, which included monthly US $80 credits for healthy foods, free grocery delivery from Shipt, and low-carbohydrate nutrition education. Food credits were restricted to the purchase of healthy foods. Education materials, developed in collaboration with providers and patients, included print, digital, interactive web, and video formats. At enrollment, participants completed a survey including demographics, diabetes health, diet and physical activity, and diabetes management and knowledge. After the 3-month program, participants completed a survey with repeat assessments of diabetes health, diet and physical activity, and diabetes management and knowledge. Perspectives on participant experience and perceived program impact, food purchasing behaviors, and use of educational materials were also collected. Diabetes health information was supplemented with data from participant medical records. We plan to perform mixed methods analysis to assess program feasibility, acceptability, and impact. Primary quality improvement (QI) measures are the number of patients referred and enrolled, use of US $80 food credits, analysis of food purchasing behavior, participant experience with the program, and program costs. Secondary QI measures include changes in hemoglobin A1c, weight, medications, self-efficacy, diabetes and carbohydrate knowledge, and activity between baseline and follow-up. Results: This program started in October 2022. Data collection is expected to be concluded in June 2024. A total of 151 patients were referred to the program, and 83 (55%) were enrolled. The average age was 57 (SD 13; range 18-86) years, 72% (57/79) were female, 90% (70/78) were White, and 96% (74/77) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity. All participants successfully ordered grocery delivery during the program. Conclusions: This pilot QI program aimed to improve diet quality among people with T2D and food insecurity by using grocery delivery and low-carbohydrate nutrition education. Our findings may help inform the implementation of future QI programs and research studies on food-as-medicine interventions that include grocery delivery and education for people with T2D.

Published by BMJ.Introduction Multiple eating patterns can promote glycaemic control and weight loss among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Clinical practice guidelines for T2D management encourage health professionals to guide patients' selection of a patient-centred eating pattern. This study aims to characterise beliefs about and recommendations for and against practice guideline-concordant eating patterns among registered dietitians (RDs) and other healthcare professionals who provide nutrition counselling to patients with T2D. Methods This was a cross-sectional online survey. We invited 82 RDs affiliated with an academic health system in the midwestern USA to participate. We also invited health professionals who provide nutrition counselling to patients with T2D and are affiliated with 264 primary care practices within the Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes. Participants were asked to select the eating pattern(s) that they commonly recommend or avoid for patients with T2D and why. Results Survey respondents (n=81) most commonly recommend low-carbohydrate (77.8%); Mediterranean-style (52.8%) and energy-modified/calorie-restricted (36.1%) eating patterns. Survey respondents most commonly recommend avoiding very low-carbohydrate (51.0%) and very low-calorie (49.0%) eating patterns. Respondents who did not recommend very low-carbohydrate were most concerned about the eating pattern being too restrictive (93.0%). Conclusions Survey respondents recommend a range of guideline-adherent eating patterns to patients with T2D but tend to recommend against very low-carbohydrate and very low-calorie eating patterns. Additional strategies are needed to increase patient-centred use of these evidence-based options in clinical practice settings.,10.1136/bmjnph-2023-000845,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-7134-970X,6506260840.0,
Lauren Oshman,Primary care physician experiences utilizing a family health history tool with electronic health record–integrated clinical decision support: an implementation process assessment,2020.0,Journal of Community Genetics,Article,Family; Family Health; Clinical decision support; Family health history; Genetic screening tool; Implementation; Precision medicine; Primary care,"2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Family health history (FHH) screening plays a key role in disease risk identification and tailored disease prevention strategies. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are in a frontline position to provide personalized medicine recommendations identified through FHH screening; however, adoption of FHH screening tools has been slow and inconsistent in practice. Information is also lacking on PCP facilitators and barriers of utilizing family history tools with clinical decision support (CDS) embedded in the electronic health record (EHR). This study reports on PCPs’ initial experiences with the Genetic and Wellness Assessment (GWA), a patient-administered FHH screening tool utilizing the EHR and CDS. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 PCPs who use the GWA in a network of community-based practices. Four main themes regarding GWA implementation emerged: benefits to clinical care, challenges in practice, CDS-specific issues, and physician-recommended improvements. Sub-themes included value in improving patient access to genetic services, inadequate time to discuss GWA recommendations, lack of patient follow-through with recommendations, and alert fatigue. While PCPs valued the GWA’s clinical utility, a number of challenges were identified in the administration and use of the GWA in practice. Based on participants’ recommendations, iterative changes have been made to the GWA and workflow to increase efficiency, upgrade the CDS process, and provide additional education to PCPs and patients. Future studies are needed to assess a diverse sample of physicians’ and patients’ perspectives on the utility of FHH screening utilizing EHR-based genomics recommendations.",10.1007/s12687-020-00454-8,NorthShore University HealthSystem,0000-0001-7134-970X,6506260840.0,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The scalable delivery of genomic medicine requires collaboration between genetics and non-genetics providers. Thus, it is essential to investigate and address the perceived value of and barriers to incorporating genetic testing into the clinical practice of primary care providers (PCPs). We used a mixed-methods approach of qualitative interviews and surveys to explore the experience of PCPs involved in the pilot DNA-10K population genetic testing program. Similar to previous research, PCPs reported low confidence with tasks related to ordering, interpreting and managing the results of genetic tests, and identified the need for additional education. PCPs endorsed high levels of utility for patients and their families but noted logistical challenges to incorporating genetic testing into their practice. Overall PCPs were not familiar with the United States’ Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and they expressed high levels of concern for patient data privacy and potential insurance discrimination. This PCP feedback led to the development and implementation of several processes to improve the PCP experience with the DNA-10K program. These results contribute to the knowledge base regarding genomic implementation using a mixed provider model and may be beneficial for institutions developing similar clinical programs.",10.3390/jpm10040165,NorthShore University HealthSystem,0000-0001-7134-970X,6506260840.0,

Fifteen states now have total or near-total bans on abortion care or no clinics providing abortion services. We review how these restrictions affect the medical care of people with pregestational diabetes. Recent Findings: Of the ten states with the highest percent of adult women living with diabetes, eight currently have complete or 6-week abortion bans. People with diabetes are at high risk of diabetes-related pregnancy complications and pregnancy-related diabetes complications and are disproportionately burdened by abortion bans. Summary: Abortion is an essential part of comprehensive, evidence-based diabetes care, yet no medical society has published guidelines on pregestational diabetes that explicitly discuss the importance and role of safe abortion care. Medical societies enacting standards for diabetes care and clinicians providing diabetes care must advocate for access to abortion to reduce pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality for pregnant people with diabetes.",10.1007/s11892-023-01512-4,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-7134-970X,6506260840.0,

Only one-third of individuals with T2D receive care as recommended by the American Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines. Effective strategies are needed to accelerate the implementation of guideline concordant T2D care. Methods: The Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D) is a statewide population health collaborative quality initiative (CQI) developed to improve the care of all people with T2D in Michigan. MCT2D has developed a learning health system with physician organizations and their constituent practices to support quality improvement initiatives focused on (1) improving use of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy to improve cardiorenal outcomes, (2) increasing evidence-based use of continuous glucose monitoring, and (3) supporting use of lower carbohydrate eating patterns. Results: Between 2021 and 2022, MCT2D recruited 28 of the 40 Michigan-based physician organizations participating in Blue Cross’ Physician Group Incentive Program with 336 constituent practices and 1357 physicians in primary care (304), endocrinology (21) and nephrology (11). In January 2022, baseline data included a sample of 96,140 unique individuals with T2D. The baseline HbA1c was ≤ 7.0% for 66.3% of patients (n = 32,787), while 14.9% of patients had a most recent HbA1c ≥ 8.0% (n = 7,393). The most recent body mass index (BMI) was ≥ 30.0 for 64.8% of patients (n = 38,516). Discussion: MCT2D has organized a statewide collaborative to recruit and engage a diverse and large set of physician organizations and their constituent practices. This is a promising opportunity to accelerate adoption of guideline-concordant care for people with T2D and may be a model for other state or regional collaboratives. Future directions include specific evidence-based interventions targeted at reducing diabetes-linked comorbidities and associated healthcare costs as well as strategies focused on T2D prevention among at-risk populations.",10.1186/s12913-024-11520-z,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-7134-970X,6506260840.0,

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Primary care patients with obesity seldom receive effective weight management treatment in primary care settings. This study aims to understand PCPs’ perspectives on obesity treatment barriers and opportunities to overcome them. Study design This is an explanatory sequential mixed methods study in which survey data was collected and used to inform subsequent qualitative interviews. Settings and participants PCPs who provide care to adult patients in an academic medical center in the Midwestern US. Methodology PCPs (n = 350) were invited by email to participate in an online survey. PCPs were subsequently invited to participate in semi-structured interviews to further explore survey domains. Analytic approach Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis. Results Among 107 survey respondents, less than 10% (n = 8) used evidence-based guidelines to inform obesity treatment decisions. PCPs’ identified opportunities to improve obesity treatment including (1) education on local obesity treatment resources (n = 78, 73%), evidence-based dietary counseling strategies (n = 67, 63%), and effective self-help resources (n = 75, 70%) and (2) enhanced team-based care with support from clinic staff (n = 53, 46%), peers trained in obesity medicine (n = 47, 44%), and dietitians (n = 58, 54%). PCPs also desired increased reimbursement for obesity treatment. While 40% (n = 39) of survey respondents expressed interest in obesity medicine training and certification through the American Board of Obesity Medicine, qualitative interviewees felt that pursuing training would require dedicated time (i.e., reduced clinical effort) and financial support. Conclusions Opportunities to improve obesity treatment in primary care settings include educational initiatives, use of team-based care models, and policy changes to incentivize obesity treatment. Primary care clinics or health systems should be encouraged to identify PCPs with specific interests in obesity medicine and support their training and certification through ABOM by reimbursing training costs and reducing clinical effort to allow for study and board examination.",10.1371/journal.pone.0284474,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,6506260840.0,

Lee A Green,The cirrhosis care Alberta (CCAB) protocol: Implementing an evidence-based best practice order set for the management of liver cirrhosis - A hybrid type i effectiveness-implementation trial,2020.0,BMC Health Services Research,Article,Cirrhosis; Consolidated framework on implementation research (CFIR); Hybrid trial; Normalization process theory (NPT); Order set; Reach-effectiveness-adoption-implementation-maintenance (RE-AIM),"2020 The Author(s).Background: Liver cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity, premature mortality and acute care utilization in patients with digestive disease. In the province of Alberta, hospital readmission rates for patients with cirrhosis are estimated at 44% at 90 days. For hospitalized patients, multiple care gaps exist, the most notable stemming from i) the lack of a structured approach to best practice care for cirrhosis complications, ii) the lack of a structured approach to broader health needs and iii) suboptimal preparation for transition of care into the community. Cirrhosis Care Alberta (CCAB) is a 4-year multi-component pragmatic trial which aims to address these gaps. The proposed intervention is initiated at the time of hospitalization through implementation of a clinical information system embedded electronic order set for delivering evidence-based best practices under real-world conditions. The overarching objective of the CCAB trial is to demonstrate effectiveness and implementation feasibility for use of the order set in routine patient care within eight hospital sites in Alberta. Methods: A mixed methods hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the order set intervention. The primary outcome is a reduction in 90-day cumulative length of stay. Implementation outcomes such as reach, adoption, fidelity and maintenance will also be evaluated alongside other patient and service outcomes such as readmission rates, quality of care and cost-effectiveness. This theory-based trial will be guided by Normalization Process Theory, Consolidated Framework on Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework. Discussion: The CCAB project is unique in its breadth, both in the comprehensiveness of the multi-component order set and also for the breadth of its roll-out. Lessons learned will ultimately inform the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in ""real-world""conditions as well as adoption and adaptation of these best practices within the rest of Alberta, other provinces in Canada, and beyond",10.1186/s12913-020-05427-8,Alberta Health Services,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

It includes the viewpoints of persons with lived experience, patient care providers, and administrators. It is imperative to build on the themes identified in this survey, through engaging all health care professionals, to develop integrated and shared care models that will allow better patient outcomes. Several patient and organizational barriers to care were identified in this survey, which must inform the development of regional care models and pragmatic solutions to improve transitions for this patient population. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in incorporating the perspectives of primary care providers and internal medicine specialists who provide the majority of HF care in Canada, which in turn limits our ability to comment on strategies for capacity building outside the HF clinic setting. These considerations must be taken into account when interpreting our findings.

Lee A Green,It's time to bring human factors to primary care policy and practice,2020.0,Applied Ergonomics,Article,Health information technology; Human factors; Primary care,"2020 Elsevier LtdPrimary health care is a complex, highly personal, and non-linear process. Care is often sub-optimal and professional burnout is high. Interventions intended to improve the situation have largely failed. This is due to a lack of a deep understanding of primary health care. Human Factors approaches and methods will aid in understanding the cognitive, social and technical needs of these specialties, and in designing and testing proposed innovations. In 2012, Ben-Tzion Karsh, Ph.D., conceived a transdisciplinary conference to frame the opportunities for research human factors and industrial engineering in primary care. In 2013, this conference brought together experts in primary care and human factors to outline areas where human factors methods can be applied. The results of this expert consensus panel highlighted four major research areas: Cognitive and social needs, patient engagement, care of community, and integration of care. Work in these areas can inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of innovations in Primary Care.

Our objective was to review the evidence, and provide recommendations and practical tips regarding the management of candidates for the following HF therapies: (1) transcatheter mitral valve repair in HF with reduced ejection fraction; (2) a novel treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis or transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; (3) angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); and (4) sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of HF in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. We emphasize the roles of optimal guideline-directed medical therapy and of multidisciplinary teams when considering transcatheter mitral valve repair, to ensure excellent evaluation and care of those patients. In the presence of suggestive clinical indices, health care providers should consider the possibility of cardiac amyloidosis and proceed with proper investigation. Tafamidis is the first agent shown in a prospective study to alter outcomes in patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Patient subgroups with HFpEF might benefit from use of sacubitril/valsartan, however, further data are needed to clarify the effect of this therapy in patients with HFpEF. Sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors reduce the risk of incident HF, HF-related hospitalizations, and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A large clinical trial recently showed that dapagliflozin provides significant outcome benefits in well treated patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%), with or without type 2 diabetes.",10.1016/j.cjca.2019.11.036,Institut de Cardiologie de Montreal,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Without supporting evidence, clinicians commonly recommend that warfarin be taken in the evening. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of administration time (morning vs evening) on the stability of warfarin’s anticoagulant effect. METHODS A total of 236 primary care physicians serving 54 western Canadian communities mailed letters of invitation to all their warfarin-using patients. Eligible patients were community-dwelling warfarin users (any indication) with at least 3 months of evening warfarin use and no plans for discontinuation. Participants were randomized (by web-based allocation) to morning vs continued evening warfarin ingestion. We used the Rosendaal method to determine the proportion of time within therapeutic range (TTR) of the international normalized ratio (INR) blood test month 2 to 7 postrandomization vs the 6 months prerandomization. The primary outcome was the percent change in proportion of time outside target INR range (with an a priori minimum clinically important difference of ±20%). All analyses were intention to treat. RESULTS Between March 8, 2015 and September 30, 2016, we randomized 109 participants to morning and 108 to evening warfarin use. TTR rose from 71.8% to 74.7% in the morning group, and from 72.6% to 75.6% in the evening group, for a change in TTR of 2.9% in the former vs 3.0% in the latter (differ-ence, –0.1%; P = .97; 95% CI for the difference, –6.1% to 5.9%). The difference in percent change in proportion of time outside the therapeutic INR range (obtained via Hodges-Lehmann estimation of the difference in medians) was 4.4% (P = .62; 95% CI for the difference, –17.6% to 27.3%). CONCLUSIONS Administration time has no statistically significant nor clinically important impact on the stability of warfarin’s anticoagulant effect. Patients should take warfarin whenever regular compliance would be easiest.",10.1370/afm.2488,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Primary care transformation is widely seen as essential to improving patient outcomes and health care costs. The medical home model can achieve these ends, but dissemination and scale-up of practice transformation is challenging. We sought to understand how to move past successful pilot efforts by early adopters to widespread adoption by applying cognitive task analysis using the diffusion of innovations framework. METHODS We undertook a qualitative cross-sectional comparison of 3 early adopter practices and 15 early majority practices in Alberta, Canada. Practices completed a total of 42 cognitive task analysis interviews. We conducted a framework-guided qualitative analysis, with allowance for emergent themes, using the macrocognition framework on which cognitive task analysis is based. Independent codings of interview transcripts for key macrocognitive functions were reviewed in group analysis meetings to describe macrocognitive functions and team mental models, and identify emergent themes. Two external focus groups provided support for these findings. RESULTS Three prominent findings emerged. The first was a spectrum of mental models from “doctor with helpers,” through degrees of delegation, to fully team based care. The second was differences in how teams distributed macrocognitive functions among members, with early adopters distributing these functions more widely across the team than early majority practices. Finally, we saw emergence of several themes also common in the diffusion of innovations literature, such as the importance of trying new practices in small, reversible steps. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide guidance to practice teams, health systems, and policymakers seeking to move beyond early adopters, to improve team functioning and advance the medical home transformation at scale.",10.1370/afm.2380,Alberta Medical Association,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,
Lee A Green,Using Concept Maps to compare obesity knowledge between policy makers and primary care researchers in Canada,2019.0,BMC Research Notes,Article,Canada; Health policy; Knowledge translation; Obesity; Primary care; Research,"2019 The Author(s).Objective: Knowledge transfer is the process of information sharing between researchers, knowledge users and policy makers. Globally, public policies about obesity do not reflect the complexity of what is known about the cause and effects of obesity. We used Concept Maps, a qualitative method that represents mental models, to compare the understanding of obesity between policy makers in a Canadian province and local primary care researchers. Eight participants were interviewed during which a Concept Map was developed using ""C-map Tools"" software. Maps were then colour-coded to identify themes and concepts in the maps. Finally, the team synthesised the findings from each of the maps and presented them back to each of the participants. Results: All participants had mental models with rich details on the complexity of obesity for individuals, community, and at the policy level. Clinician-researchers had more focus on medical management than policy makers although most participants lacked concepts on the role of primary care in obesity management. A shared understanding of obesity could assist researchers and policy makers in developing a relevant and effective strategy. Concept Mapping provides a novel and creative way to visually compare different understandings of health-related topics.",10.1186/s13104-018-4042-x,National Centre for Epidemiology &amp; Population Health,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Design A qualitative study using Cognitive Task Analysis for physician interviews and peer-to-peer semistructured interviews for patients according to the Patient and Community Engagement Research (PaCER) method. Setting Primary care practices and patient researchers at an academic centre in Southern Alberta. Participants Intentional sampling of family physicians (n=4; 75% women) and patients with KOA who had taken part in previous PaCER studies and had experienced knee pain on most days of the month at any time in the past (n=5; 60% women). Results Physician and patient views about KOA were starkly contrasting. Patient participants expressed that KOA seriously impacted their lives and lifestyles, and they wanted their knee pain to be considered as important as other health problems. In contrast, physicians uniformly conceptualised KOA as a relatively minor health problem, although they still recognised it as a painful condition that often limits patients' activities. Consequently, physicians did not regard KOA as a condition to be proactively and aggressively managed. The gap between physicians' and patients' conceptualisation of KOA and its treatment extended to the use of an app for self-management. While patients were supportive of the app, physicians were sceptical of its use and focused more on accountability and patient resources. Conclusions The clear discord between physicians' mental models and patients' lived experience and perceived needs around KOA emphasised a gap in understanding and communication about treatment and management of KOA. As such, this preliminary and formative research will inform a codesign approach to develop an app that will act as a communications tool between patients and physicians, enabling patient-physician discussions regarding modifiable self-management options based on a patient's perspectives and needs.",10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024016,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Setting Alberta. Participants Nine FP colonoscopists. Main outcome measures Proportion of successful cecal intubations; proportion of patients aged 50 and older with pathologically confirmed adenomas; mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy; and serious adverse events related to colonoscopy. Results In this 6-month study, 9 rural FPs in Alberta performed 1769 colonoscopies. Overall, all key colonoscopy quality benchmarks were met or exceeded. The proportion of successful cecal intubations was 97.9% (95% CI 97.2% to 98.6%). The proportion of male and female patients aged 50 and older whose first-time colonoscopy results revealed an adenoma was 67.4% (95% CI 62.4% to 72.7%) and 51.1% (95% CI 45.5% to 56.7%), respectively. There were 120 adenomas, 36 advanced adenomas, and 1 colon cancer case per 100 colonoscopies. There were 2 postpolypectomy bleeds and no other serious complications. Conclusion Alberta rural FP colonoscopists are meeting benchmarks in colonoscopy quality. Ongoing electronic collection of endoscopy quality markers should be encouraged.

Most published studies examine team-based care from the perspective of health professionals. The purpose of this study was to examine patients' perceptions of team-based care in family practice. METHODS: This was a waiting room survey conducted in five family medicine academic teaching clinics in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Patients aged ≥18 years were invited to participate in a survey addressing patient access to team-based care, perceived benefits, preferred health professional and team member roles. RESULTS: Of the 44.3% (565/1274) of respondents, 41.8% (231/552) reported receiving care from a team of health professionals, primarily for chronic disease management or pharmacy consultations. While there was a consistent pattern of patient perception that many aspects of care did not worsen with team-based care, improvements in knowledge of their medical condition (67.4%); the care received (65.0%); access to care (51.1%); ability to self-care (48.9%) and maintain their independence (43.7%); and overall health (51.1%) were reported. Some patients felt that team-based care reduced emergency visits (34.6%) and hospitalisations (29.9%), and 44.1% of patients felt that they had an active role on the team and made decisions about their care together with health professionals. CONCLUSION: Patients perceive that team-based care in family practice has improved their knowledge and access to care, overall health and avoided some emergency department visits and hospital admissions. The findings support the continued development of team-based care in family practice.",10.1071/HC18018,"University of Alberta, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry",0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,
Lee A Green,Designing a framework for primary health care research in Canada: A scoping literature review,2018.0,BMC Family Practice,Review,Canada; Primary health care; Research priorities; Research transfer,"2018 The Author(s).Background: Despite significant investments to improve primary health care (PHC) delivery in Canada, provincial health care systems remain fragmented and uncoordinated. Canada's commitment to strengthening PHC should be driven by robust research and evaluation that reflects our health policy priorities and responds to the needs of the population. One challenge facing health services researchers is developing and sustaining meaningful research priorities and agendas in an overburdened, complex health care system with limited capacity for PHC research and support for clinician researchers. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was conducted to examine PHC research priorities in Canada. We compared national research priorities for PHC to research priorities being considered in the province of Alberta. Our scoping review was guided by the following questions: (1) What are the research priorities for PHC in Canada?; and (2) What process is used to identity PHC research priorities? Results: Six key theme areas for consideration in setting a PHC research agenda were identified: research in practice, research on practice, research about practice, methods of priority setting, infrastructure, and the intersection of PHC and population/public health. These thematic areas provide a new framework for guiding PHC research in Canada. It was developed to generate best practices and new knowledge (i.e., innovation), transform PHC clinical practice or support quality improvement (i.e., spread), and lead to large-scale health care system transformation (i.e., scale). Conclusions: Priority-driven research aims to answer questions of key importance that are likely to have a significant impact on knowledge or practice in the short to medium term. Setting PHC research priorities ensures funded research has the greatest potential population health benefit, that research funding and outputs are aligned with the needs of practitioners and decision makers, and that there is efficient and equitable use of limited resources with less duplication of research effort. Our findings also suggest that a common research priority framework for PHC research in Canada would ensure that research priority-setting exercises are grounded in an evidence-based process.",10.1186/s12875-018-0839-x,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

We compared health outcomes associated with primary care networks versus conventional primary care. METHODS: We obtained data on all adult residents of Alberta who visited a primary care physician during fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and classified them as affiliated with a primary care network or not, based on the physician most involved in their care. The primary outcome was an emergency department visit or nonelective hospital admission for a Patient Medical Home indicator condition (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, coronary disease, hypertension and diabetes) within 12 months. RESULTS: Adults receiving care within a primary care network (n = 1ff502ff916) were older and had higher comorbidity burdens than those receiving conventional primary care (n = 1ff109ff941). Patients in a primary care network were less likely to visit the emergency department for an indicator condition (1.4% v. 1.7%, mean 0.031 v. 0.035 per patient, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-0.99) or for any cause (25.5% v. 30.5%, mean 0.55 v. 0.72 per patient, adjusted RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93-0.94), but were more likely to be admitted to hospital for an indicator condition (0.6% v. 0.6%, mean 0.018 v. 0.017 per patient, adjusted RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11) or all-cause (9.3% v. 9.1%, mean 0.25 v. 0.23 per patient, adjusted RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.09). Patients in a primary care network had 169 fewer all-cause emergency department visits and 86 fewer days in hospital (owing to shorter lengths of stay) per 1000 patient-years. INTERPRETATION: Care within a primary care network was associated with fewer emergency department visits and fewer hospital days.",10.1503/cmaj.170385,Patient Health Outcomes Research and Clinical Effectiveness,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction Hospital and emergency department discharge for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often poorly organised. We developed a patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge care bundle for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Methods A purposeful sample of clinicians and patients were invited to participate in a two-round Delphi study (July-November 2015). In round 1, participants rated on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not at all important; 7=extremely important) the importance of 29 unique COPD care actions. Round 2 comprised items selected from round 1 based on consensus (>80% endorsement for Likert values 5-7). A list of 18 care items from round 2 was discussed in a face-to-face nominal group meeting. Results Seven care items were included in the COPD discharge bundle based on clinician and patient input: (1) ensure adequate inhaler technique is demonstrated; (2) send discharge summary to family physician and arrange follow-up; (3) optimise and reconcile prescription of respiratory medications; (4) provide a written discharge management plan and assess patient's and caregiver's comprehension of discharge instructions; (5) refer to pulmonary rehabilitation; (6) screen for frailty and comorbidities; and (7) assess smoking status, provide counselling and refer to smoking cessation programme. Conclusion We present a seven-item, patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge bundle for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Alignment with clinical practice guidelines and feasibility of local adaptations of the bundle should be explored to facilitate wide applicability and evaluation of the effectiveness of the COPD discharge bundle.",10.1136/bmjresp-2017-000265,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Over the past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations is presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores, the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction, exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced therapies as well as end of life considerations. Finally, we acknowledge the remaining gaps in evidence that need to be filled by future research.",10.1016/j.cjca.2017.08.022,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Care management is often, but not always, proving effective at improving patient outcomes, but more evidence is needed. Methods: In this pair-matched cluster randomized trial, 5 practices implemented care management and were compared with 5 comparison practices within the same practice organization. Targeted patients included diabetic patients with a hemoglobin A1c >9% and nondiabetic obese patients. Clinical values tracked were A1c, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, microalbumin, and weight. Results: Clinically important improvements were demonstrated in the intervention versus comparison practices, with diabetic patients improving A1c control and obese patients experiencing weight loss. There was a 12% relative increase in the proportion of patients meeting the clinical target of A1c <7% (95% CI, 3%-20%), and 26% of obese nondiabetic patients in chronic care management practices lost 5% or more of their body weight as compared with 10% of comparison patients (adjusted relative improvement, 15%; CI, 2%-28%).

To manage its common adverse psychosocial and cognitive outcomes, early identification of HL must be improved. Methods A feasibility study conducted to increase screening for HL and referral of patients aged ≥55 years arriving at two family medicine clinics. Eligible patients were asked to complete a self-administered consent form and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI). Independently, clinicians received a brief educational program after which an electronic clinical prompt (intervention) alerted them (blinded to HHI results) to screen for HL during applicable patient visits. Pre- and post-intervention differences were analyzed to assess the proportion of patients referred to audiology and those diagnosed with HL (primary outcomes) and the audiology referral appropriateness (secondary outcome). Referral rates for those who screened positive for HL on the HHI were compared with those who scored negatively. Results There were 5,520 eligible patients during the study period, of which 1,236 (22.4%) consented. After the intervention's implementation, audiology referral rates increased from 1.2% to 7.1% (p<0.001). Overall, 293 consented patients (24%) completed the HHI and scored >10, indicating probable HL. Of these 293 patients, 28.0% were referred to audiology versus only 7.4% with scores <10 (p<0.001). Forty-two of the 54 referred patients seen by audiology were diagnosed with HL (78%). Overall, the diagnosis of HL on problem lists increased from 90 of 4,815 patients (1.9%) at baseline to 163 of 5,520 patients (3.0%, p<0.001) over only 8 months.

One common approach utilizes electronic clinical alerts to prompt clinicians when certain interventions are due for individual patients being seen. However, these alerts have not been consistently effective, particularly for less visible (though important) conditions such as hearing loss (HL) screening. Materials and Methods: We conducted hour-long cognitive task analysis interviews to explore how family medicine clinicians view, perceive, and use electronic clinical alerts, and to utilize this information to design a more effective alert using HL identification and referral as a model diagnosis. Results: Four key direct barriers were identified that impeded alert use: poor standardization and formatting, time pressures in primary care, clinic workflow variations, and mental models of the condition being prompted (in this case, HL). One indirect barrier was identified: electronic health record and institution/government regulations. We identified that clinicians' mental model of the condition being prompted was probably the major barrier, though this was often expressed as time pressure. We discuss solutions to each of the 5 identified barriers, such as addressing physicians' mental models, by focusing on physicians' expertise rather than knowledge to improve their comfort when caring for patients with the conditions being prompted. Conclusions: To unleash the potential of electronic clinical alerts, electronic health record and health care institutions need to address some key barriers. We outline these barriers and propose solutions.",10.1093/jamia/ocw178,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Practices have limited capacity to cope with this transformation. Thousands of practices require support, and any intervention must both scale to that level and be usable by practices with limited change capacity. Various organizations train practice facilitators (PFs) to help with this transformation. We developed a training program for PFs to learn the basics of cognitive task analysis (CTA) to analyze and advise practices and to help them transform by improving macrocognitive functions. The training program comprised preparatory readings and 14 hr of didactic sessions and guided exercises over 2 days. That preparation was followed by a three-interview progression under actual field conditions: seconding for an experienced lead interviewer, leading with an experience interviewer as second, and leading with another PF as second. The data collection, analysis, and reporting are highly structured, tailored to the constraints of primary care, and scalable. Early experience with practices in Alberta indicates the resulting CTA reports to have significant impact.

Green,2017 Comprehensive Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure,2017.0,Canadian Journal of Cardiology,Article,Ear; Heart; Heart Failure; Art,"2017 Canadian Cardiovascular SocietySince the inception of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure (HF) guidelines in 2006, much has changed in the care for patients with HF. Over the past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations is presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores, the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction, exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced therapies as well as end of life considerations. Finally, we acknowledge the remaining gaps in evidence that need to be filled by future research.",10.1016/j.cjca.2017.08.022,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.Objective To determine whether rural FP colonoscopists in Alberta are achieving benchmarks in colonoscopy quality. Design Prospective, multicentre observational study. Setting Alberta. Participants Nine FP colonoscopists. Main outcome measures Proportion of successful cecal intubations; proportion of patients aged 50 and older with pathologically confirmed adenomas; mean number of adenomas per colonoscopy; and serious adverse events related to colonoscopy. Results In this 6-month study, 9 rural FPs in Alberta performed 1769 colonoscopies. Overall, all key colonoscopy quality benchmarks were met or exceeded. The proportion of successful cecal intubations was 97.9% (95% CI 97.2% to 98.6%). The proportion of male and female patients aged 50 and older whose first-time colonoscopy results revealed an adenoma was 67.4% (95% CI 62.4% to 72.7%) and 51.1% (95% CI 45.5% to 56.7%), respectively. There were 120 adenomas, 36 advanced adenomas, and 1 colon cancer case per 100 colonoscopies. There were 2 postpolypectomy bleeds and no other serious complications. Conclusion Alberta rural FP colonoscopists are meeting benchmarks in colonoscopy quality. Ongoing electronic collection of endoscopy quality markers should be encouraged.

Our objective was to review the evidence, and provide recommendations and practical tips regarding the management of candidates for the following HF therapies: (1) transcatheter mitral valve repair in HF with reduced ejection fraction; (2) a novel treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis or transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; (3) angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition in patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); and (4) sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of HF in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. We emphasize the roles of optimal guideline-directed medical therapy and of multidisciplinary teams when considering transcatheter mitral valve repair, to ensure excellent evaluation and care of those patients. In the presence of suggestive clinical indices, health care providers should consider the possibility of cardiac amyloidosis and proceed with proper investigation. Tafamidis is the first agent shown in a prospective study to alter outcomes in patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. Patient subgroups with HFpEF might benefit from use of sacubitril/valsartan, however, further data are needed to clarify the effect of this therapy in patients with HFpEF. Sodium glucose cotransport inhibitors reduce the risk of incident HF, HF-related hospitalizations, and cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Lee A. Green,Designing a framework for primary health care research in Canada: A scoping literature review,2018.0,BMC Family Practice,Review,Ear; Research; Work; Literature; Primary Health Care; Canada; Primary health care; Research priorities; Research transfer,"2018 The Author(s).Background: Despite significant investments to improve primary health care (PHC) delivery in Canada, provincial health care systems remain fragmented and uncoordinated. Canada's commitment to strengthening PHC should be driven by robust research and evaluation that reflects our health policy priorities and responds to the needs of the population. One challenge facing health services researchers is developing and sustaining meaningful research priorities and agendas in an overburdened, complex health care system with limited capacity for PHC research and support for clinician researchers. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was conducted to examine PHC research priorities in Canada. We compared national research priorities for PHC to research priorities being considered in the province of Alberta. Our scoping review was guided by the following questions: (1) What are the research priorities for PHC in Canada?; and (2) What process is used to identity PHC research priorities? Results: Six key theme areas for consideration in setting a PHC research agenda were identified: research in practice, research on practice, research about practice, methods of priority setting, infrastructure, and the intersection of PHC and population/public health. These thematic areas provide a new framework for guiding PHC research in Canada. It was developed to generate best practices and new knowledge (i.e., innovation), transform PHC clinical practice or support quality improvement (i.e., spread), and lead to large-scale health care system transformation (i.e., scale). Conclusions: Priority-driven research aims to answer questions of key importance that are likely to have a significant impact on knowledge or practice in the short to medium term. Setting PHC research priorities ensures funded research has the greatest potential population health benefit, that research funding and outputs are aligned with the needs of practitioners and decision makers, and that there is efficient and equitable use of limited resources with less duplication of research effort. Our findings also suggest that a common research priority framework for PHC research in Canada would ensure that research priority-setting exercises are grounded in an evidence-based process.",10.1186/s12875-018-0839-x,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction Hospital and emergency department discharge for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often poorly organised. We developed a patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge care bundle for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Methods A purposeful sample of clinicians and patients were invited to participate in a two-round Delphi study (July-November 2015). In round 1, participants rated on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not at all important; 7=extremely important) the importance of 29 unique COPD care actions. Round 2 comprised items selected from round 1 based on consensus (>80% endorsement for Likert values 5-7). A list of 18 care items from round 2 was discussed in a face-to-face nominal group meeting. Results Seven care items were included in the COPD discharge bundle based on clinician and patient input: (1) ensure adequate inhaler technique is demonstrated; (2) send discharge summary to family physician and arrange follow-up; (3) optimise and reconcile prescription of respiratory medications; (4) provide a written discharge management plan and assess patient's and caregiver's comprehension of discharge instructions; (5) refer to pulmonary rehabilitation; (6) screen for frailty and comorbidities; and (7) assess smoking status, provide counselling and refer to smoking cessation programme. Conclusion We present a seven-item, patient-centred, evidence-based and consensus-based discharge bundle for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Alignment with clinical practice guidelines and feasibility of local adaptations of the bundle should be explored to facilitate wide applicability and evaluation of the effectiveness of the COPD discharge bundle.",10.1136/bmjresp-2017-000265,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Care management is often, but not always, proving effective at improving patient outcomes, but more evidence is needed. Methods: In this pair-matched cluster randomized trial, 5 practices implemented care management and were compared with 5 comparison practices within the same practice organization. Targeted patients included diabetic patients with a hemoglobin A1c >9% and nondiabetic obese patients. Clinical values tracked were A1c, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, microalbumin, and weight. Results: Clinically important improvements were demonstrated in the intervention versus comparison practices, with diabetic patients improving A1c control and obese patients experiencing weight loss. There was a 12% relative increase in the proportion of patients meeting the clinical target of A1c <7% (95% CI, 3%-20%), and 26% of obese nondiabetic patients in chronic care management practices lost 5% or more of their body weight as compared with 10% of comparison patients (adjusted relative improvement, 15%; CI, 2%-28%). Conclusions: These findings add to the growing evidence-base for the effectiveness of care management as an effective clinical practice with regard to improving diabetes- and obesity-related outcomes.",10.1177/2150131917715536,University of Colorado School of Medicine,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Primary care transformation is widely seen as essential to improving patient outcomes and health care costs. The medical home model can achieve these ends, but dissemination and scale-up of practice transformation is challenging. We sought to understand how to move past successful pilot efforts by early adopters to widespread adoption by applying cognitive task analysis using the diffusion of innovations framework. METHODS We undertook a qualitative cross-sectional comparison of 3 early adopter practices and 15 early majority practices in Alberta, Canada. Practices completed a total of 42 cognitive task analysis interviews. We conducted a framework-guided qualitative analysis, with allowance for emergent themes, using the macrocognition framework on which cognitive task analysis is based. Independent codings of interview transcripts for key macrocognitive functions were reviewed in group analysis meetings to describe macrocognitive functions and team mental models, and identify emergent themes. Two external focus groups provided support for these findings. RESULTS Three prominent findings emerged. The first was a spectrum of mental models from “doctor with helpers,” through degrees of delegation, to fully team based care. The second was differences in how teams distributed macrocognitive functions among members, with early adopters distributing these functions more widely across the team than early majority practices. Finally, we saw emergence of several themes also common in the diffusion of innovations literature, such as the importance of trying new practices in small, reversible steps. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide guidance to practice teams, health systems, and policymakers seeking to move beyond early adopters, to improve team functioning and advance the medical home transformation at scale.",10.1370/afm.2380,Alberta Medical Association,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Hearing loss, the second most common disability in the United States, is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Identifying it in early stages could prevent its known substantial adverse outcomes. METHODS A multiple baseline design was implemented to assess a screening paradigm for identifying and referring patients aged ≥55 years with hearing loss at 10 family medicine clinics in 2 health systems. Patients completed a consent form and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHI). An electronic alert prompted clinicians to screen for hearing loss during visits. RESULTS The 14,877 eligible patients during the study period had 36,701 encounters. Referral rates in the family medicine clinics increased from a baseline rate of 3.2% to 14.4% in 1 health system and from a baseline rate of 0.7% to 4.7% in the other. A general medicine comparison group showed referral rate increase from the 3.0% baseline rate to 3.3%. Of the 5,883 study patients who completed the HHI 25.2% (n = 1,484) had HHI scores suggestive of hearing loss; those patients had higher referral rates, 28% vs 9.2% (P <001). Of 1,660 patients referred for hearing testing, 717 had audiology data available for analysis: 669 (93.3%) were rated appropriately referred and 421 (58.7%) were considered hearing aid candi-dates. Overall, 71.5% of patients contacted felt their referral was appropriate. CONCLUSION An electronic alert used to remind clinicians to ask patients aged ≥55 years about hearing loss significantly increased audiology referrals for at-risk patients. Audiologic and audiogram data support the effectiveness of the prompt.

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Hearing loss (HL) is underdiagnosed and often unaddressed. A recent study of screening for HL using an electronic prompt showed efficacy in increasing appropriate referrals for subsequent testing. We build on the results of this study using a qualitative lens to explore implementation processes through the perspectives of family medicine clinicians. METHODS We collected clinic observations and semistructured interviews of family medicine clinicians and residents who interacted with the HL prompt. All data were analyzed using thematic, framework, and mixed methods integration strategies. RESULTS We interviewed 27 clinicians and conducted 10 observations. Thematic analysis resulted in 6 themes: (1) the prompt was overwhelmingly viewed as easy, simple to use, accurate; (2) clinicians considered prompt as an effective way to increase awareness and conversations with patients about HL; (3) clinician and staff buy-in played a vital role in implementation; (4) clinicians prioritized prompt during annual visits; (5) medical assistant involvement in prompt workflow varied by health system, clinic, and clinician; (6) prompt resulted in more conversations about HL, but uncertain impact on patient outcomes. Themes are presented alongside constructs of normalization process theory and intervention outcomes. CONCLUSION Integration of a HL screening prompt into clinical practice varied by clinician buy-in and beliefs about the impact on patient outcomes, involvement of medical assistants, and prioritization during clinical visits. Further research is needed to understand how to leverage clinician and staff buy-in and whether implementation of a new clinical prompt has sustained impact on HL screening and patient outcomes.",10.1370/AFM.2695,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,

Lee A. Green,Initial Results of the Early Auditory Referral-Primary Care (EAR-PC) Study,2017.0,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,Article,Ear,"2017Introduction Hearing loss (HL) is the second most common disability in the U.S., yet is clinically underdiagnosed. To manage its common adverse psychosocial and cognitive outcomes, early identification of HL must be improved. Methods A feasibility study conducted to increase screening for HL and referral of patients aged ≥55 years arriving at two family medicine clinics. Eligible patients were asked to complete a self-administered consent form and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI). Independently, clinicians received a brief educational program after which an electronic clinical prompt (intervention) alerted them (blinded to HHI results) to screen for HL during applicable patient visits. Pre- and post-intervention differences were analyzed to assess the proportion of patients referred to audiology and those diagnosed with HL (primary outcomes) and the audiology referral appropriateness (secondary outcome). Referral rates for those who screened positive for HL on the HHI were compared with those who scored negatively. Results There were 5,520 eligible patients during the study period, of which 1,236 (22.4%) consented. After the intervention's implementation, audiology referral rates increased from 1.2% to 7.1% (p<0.001). Overall, 293 consented patients (24%) completed the HHI and scored >10, indicating probable HL. Of these 293 patients, 28.0% were referred to audiology versus only 7.4% with scores <10 (p<0.001). Forty-two of the 54 referred patients seen by audiology were diagnosed with HL (78%). Overall, the diagnosis of HL on problem lists increased from 90 of 4,815 patients (1.9%) at baseline to 163 of 5,520 patients (3.0%, p<0.001) over only 8 months.

Most published studies examine team-based care from the perspective of health professionals. The purpose of this study was to examine patients' perceptions of team-based care in family practice. METHODS: This was a waiting room survey conducted in five family medicine academic teaching clinics in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Patients aged ≥18 years were invited to participate in a survey addressing patient access to team-based care, perceived benefits, preferred health professional and team member roles. RESULTS: Of the 44.3% (565/1274) of respondents, 41.8% (231/552) reported receiving care from a team of health professionals, primarily for chronic disease management or pharmacy consultations. While there was a consistent pattern of patient perception that many aspects of care did not worsen with team-based care, improvements in knowledge of their medical condition (67.4%); the care received (65.0%); access to care (51.1%); ability to self-care (48.9%) and maintain their independence (43.7%); and overall health (51.1%) were reported. Some patients felt that team-based care reduced emergency visits (34.6%) and hospitalisations (29.9%), and 44.1% of patients felt that they had an active role on the team and made decisions about their care together with health professionals. CONCLUSION: Patients perceive that team-based care in family practice has improved their knowledge and access to care, overall health and avoided some emergency department visits and hospital admissions. The findings support the continued development of team-based care in family practice.",10.1071/HC18018,"University of Alberta, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry",0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Results Physician and patient views about KOA were starkly contrasting. Patient participants expressed that KOA seriously impacted their lives and lifestyles, and they wanted their knee pain to be considered as important as other health problems. In contrast, physicians uniformly conceptualised KOA as a relatively minor health problem, although they still recognised it as a painful condition that often limits patients' activities. Consequently, physicians did not regard KOA as a condition to be proactively and aggressively managed. The gap between physicians' and patients' conceptualisation of KOA and its treatment extended to the use of an app for self-management. While patients were supportive of the app, physicians were sceptical of its use and focused more on accountability and patient resources. Conclusions The clear discord between physicians' mental models and patients' lived experience and perceived needs around KOA emphasised a gap in understanding and communication about treatment and management of KOA. As such, this preliminary and formative research will inform a codesign approach to develop an app that will act as a communications tool between patients and physicians, enabling patient-physician discussions regarding modifiable self-management options based on a patient's perspectives and needs.",10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024016,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Data Sources and Study Setting: All patients aged 18 years and older in 2,218 primary care practices participating in a statewide PCMH incentive program sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) in 2009–2012. Study Design: Quantitative observational study, jointly modeling PCMH-targeted versus other hospital admissions and ED visits on PCMH score, patient, and practice characteristics in a hierarchical multivariate model using the generalized gamma distribution. Data Collection: Claims data and PCMH scores held by BCBSM. Principal Findings: Both hospital and ED utilization were reduced proportionately to PCMH score. Hospital utilization was reduced by 13.9 percent for PCMH-targeted conditions versus only 3.8 percent for other conditions (p =.003), and ED utilization by 11.2 percent versus 3.7 percent (p =.010). Hospital PMPM cost was reduced by 17.2 percent for PCMH-targeted conditions versus only 3.1 percent for other conditions (p <.001), and ED PMPM cost by 9.4 percent versus 3.6 percent (p <.001). Conclusions: PCMH transformation reduces hospital and ED use, and the majority of the effect is specific to PCMH-targeted conditions.",10.1111/1475-6773.12674,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,
Lee A. Green,The Status of Specialized Ambulatory Heart Failure Care in Canada: A Joint Canadian Heart Failure Society and Canadian Cardiovascular Society Heart Failure Guidelines Survey,2020.0,CJC Open,Review,Ear; Heart; Heart Failure; Art,"2020 Canadian Cardiovascular SocietyThis joint Canadian Heart Failure Society and the CCS Heart Failure guidelines report has been developed to provide a pan-Canadian snapshot of the current state of clinic-based ambulatory heart failure (HF) care in Canada with specific reference to elements and processes of care associated with quality and high performing health systems. It includes the viewpoints of persons with lived experience, patient care providers, and administrators. It is imperative to build on the themes identified in this survey, through engaging all health care professionals, to develop integrated and shared care models that will allow better patient outcomes. Several patient and organizational barriers to care were identified in this survey, which must inform the development of regional care models and pragmatic solutions to improve transitions for this patient population. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in incorporating the perspectives of primary care providers and internal medicine specialists who provide the majority of HF care in Canada, which in turn limits our ability to comment on strategies for capacity building outside the HF clinic setting. These considerations must be taken into account when interpreting our findings. Engaging all HF care providers, to build on the themes identified in this survey, will be an important next step in developing integrated and shared care models known to improve patient outcomes.",10.1016/j.cjco.2020.03.001,The University of British Columbia,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Lee A. Green,The cirrhosis care Alberta (CCAB) protocol: Implementing an evidence-based best practice order set for the management of liver cirrhosis - A hybrid type i effectiveness-implementation trial,2020.0,BMC Health Services Research,Article,Liver Cirrhosis; Tin; Cirrhosis; Consolidated framework on implementation research (CFIR); Hybrid trial; Normalization process theory (NPT); Order set; Reach-effectiveness-adoption-implementation-maintenance (RE-AIM),"2020 The Author(s).Background: Liver cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity, premature mortality and acute care utilization in patients with digestive disease. In the province of Alberta, hospital readmission rates for patients with cirrhosis are estimated at 44% at 90 days. For hospitalized patients, multiple care gaps exist, the most notable stemming from i) the lack of a structured approach to best practice care for cirrhosis complications, ii) the lack of a structured approach to broader health needs and iii) suboptimal preparation for transition of care into the community. Cirrhosis Care Alberta (CCAB) is a 4-year multi-component pragmatic trial which aims to address these gaps. The proposed intervention is initiated at the time of hospitalization through implementation of a clinical information system embedded electronic order set for delivering evidence-based best practices under real-world conditions. The overarching objective of the CCAB trial is to demonstrate effectiveness and implementation feasibility for use of the order set in routine patient care within eight hospital sites in Alberta. Methods: A mixed methods hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the order set intervention. The primary outcome is a reduction in 90-day cumulative length of stay. Implementation outcomes such as reach, adoption, fidelity and maintenance will also be evaluated alongside other patient and service outcomes such as readmission rates, quality of care and cost-effectiveness. This theory-based trial will be guided by Normalization Process Theory, Consolidated Framework on Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework. Discussion: The CCAB project is unique in its breadth, both in the comprehensiveness of the multi-component order set and also for the breadth of its roll-out. Lessons learned will ultimately inform the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in ""real-world""conditions as well as adoption and adaptation of these best practices within the rest of Alberta, other provinces in Canada, and beyond",10.1186/s12913-020-05427-8,Alberta Health Services,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,
Lee A. Green,The effect of provider affiliation with a primary care network on emergency department visits and hospital admissions,2018.0,CMAJ,Article,Work; Art,"2018 Joule Inc.Background: Primary care networks are designed to facilitate access to interprofessional, team-based care. We compared health outcomes associated with primary care networks versus conventional primary care. METHODS: We obtained data on all adult residents of Alberta who visited a primary care physician during fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and classified them as affiliated with a primary care network or not, based on the physician most involved in their care. The primary outcome was an emergency department visit or nonelective hospital admission for a Patient Medical Home indicator condition (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, coronary disease, hypertension and diabetes) within 12 months. RESULTS: Adults receiving care within a primary care network (n = 1ff502ff916) were older and had higher comorbidity burdens than those receiving conventional primary care (n = 1ff109ff941). Patients in a primary care network were less likely to visit the emergency department for an indicator condition (1.4% v. 1.7%, mean 0.031 v. 0.035 per patient, adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-0.99) or for any cause (25.5% v. 30.5%, mean 0.55 v. 0.72 per patient, adjusted RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.93-0.94), but were more likely to be admitted to hospital for an indicator condition (0.6% v. 0.6%, mean 0.018 v. 0.017 per patient, adjusted RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11) or all-cause (9.3% v. 9.1%, mean 0.25 v. 0.23 per patient, adjusted RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.09). Patients in a primary care network had 169 fewer all-cause emergency department visits and 86 fewer days in hospital (owing to shorter lengths of stay) per 1000 patient-years. INTERPRETATION: Care within a primary care network was associated with fewer emergency department visits and fewer hospital days.",10.1503/cmaj.170385,Patient Health Outcomes Research and Clinical Effectiveness,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Without supporting evidence, clinicians commonly recommend that warfarin be taken in the evening. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of administration time (morning vs evening) on the stability of warfarin’s anticoagulant effect. METHODS A total of 236 primary care physicians serving 54 western Canadian communities mailed letters of invitation to all their warfarin-using patients. Eligible patients were community-dwelling warfarin users (any indication) with at least 3 months of evening warfarin use and no plans for discontinuation. Participants were randomized (by web-based allocation) to morning vs continued evening warfarin ingestion. We used the Rosendaal method to determine the proportion of time within therapeutic range (TTR) of the international normalized ratio (INR) blood test month 2 to 7 postrandomization vs the 6 months prerandomization. The primary outcome was the percent change in proportion of time outside target INR range (with an a priori minimum clinically important difference of ±20%). All analyses were intention to treat. RESULTS Between March 8, 2015 and September 30, 2016, we randomized 109 participants to morning and 108 to evening warfarin use. TTR rose from 71.8% to 74.7% in the morning group, and from 72.6% to 75.6% in the evening group, for a change in TTR of 2.9% in the former vs 3.0% in the latter (differ-ence, –0.1%; P = .97; 95% CI for the difference, –6.1% to 5.9%). The difference in percent change in proportion of time outside the therapeutic INR range (obtained via Hodges-Lehmann estimation of the difference in medians) was 4.4% (P = .62; 95% CI for the difference, –17.6% to 27.3%). CONCLUSIONS Administration time has no statistically significant nor clinically important impact on the stability of warfarin’s anticoagulant effect. Patients should take warfarin whenever regular compliance would be easiest.",10.1370/afm.2488,University of Alberta,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Green,To act or not to act: Responses to electronic health record prompts by family medicine clinicians,2017.0,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,Article,Family; Best practice alerts; EHR; Electronic prompts,"The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association. All rights reserved.Objective: A major focus of health care today is a strong emphasis on improving the health and quality of care for entire patient populations. One common approach utilizes electronic clinical alerts to prompt clinicians when certain interventions are due for individual patients being seen. However, these alerts have not been consistently effective, particularly for less visible (though important) conditions such as hearing loss (HL) screening. Materials and Methods: We conducted hour-long cognitive task analysis interviews to explore how family medicine clinicians view, perceive, and use electronic clinical alerts, and to utilize this information to design a more effective alert using HL identification and referral as a model diagnosis. Results: Four key direct barriers were identified that impeded alert use: poor standardization and formatting, time pressures in primary care, clinic workflow variations, and mental models of the condition being prompted (in this case, HL). One indirect barrier was identified: electronic health record and institution/government regulations. We identified that clinicians' mental model of the condition being prompted was probably the major barrier, though this was often expressed as time pressure. We discuss solutions to each of the 5 identified barriers, such as addressing physicians' mental models, by focusing on physicians' expertise rather than knowledge to improve their comfort when caring for patients with the conditions being prompted. Conclusions: To unleash the potential of electronic clinical alerts, electronic health record and health care institutions need to address some key barriers. We outline these barriers and propose solutions.",10.1093/jamia/ocw178,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Practices have limited capacity to cope with this transformation. Thousands of practices require support, and any intervention must both scale to that level and be usable by practices with limited change capacity. Various organizations train practice facilitators (PFs) to help with this transformation. We developed a training program for PFs to learn the basics of cognitive task analysis (CTA) to analyze and advise practices and to help them transform by improving macrocognitive functions. The training program comprised preparatory readings and 14 hr of didactic sessions and guided exercises over 2 days. That preparation was followed by a three-interview progression under actual field conditions: seconding for an experienced lead interviewer, leading with an experience interviewer as second, and leading with another PF as second. The data collection, analysis, and reporting are highly structured, tailored to the constraints of primary care, and scalable. Early experience with practices in Alberta indicates the resulting CTA reports to have significant impact. PFs have spontaneously transferred their use of CTA skills to other areas of their facilitation work.",10.1177/1555343416657237,State University of New York Albany,0000-0002-1789-7366,55307878900.0,

Globally, public policies about obesity do not reflect the complexity of what is known about the cause and effects of obesity. We used Concept Maps, a qualitative method that represents mental models, to compare the understanding of obesity between policy makers in a Canadian province and local primary care researchers. Eight participants were interviewed during which a Concept Map was developed using ""C-map Tools"" software. Maps were then colour-coded to identify themes and concepts in the maps. Finally, the team synthesised the findings from each of the maps and presented them back to each of the participants. Results: All participants had mental models with rich details on the complexity of obesity for individuals, community, and at the policy level. Clinician-researchers had more focus on medical management than policy makers although most participants lacked concepts on the role of primary care in obesity management. A shared understanding of obesity could assist researchers and policy makers in developing a relevant and effective strategy.

To better characterise the association between convalescent immunesenescence and acute disease severity, we determined the immune phenotype of COVID-19 survivors and non-infected controls. Results: We performed detailed immune phenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 103 COVID-19 survivors 3–5 months post recovery who were classified as having had severe (n = 56; age 53.12 ± 11.30 years), moderate (n = 32; age 52.28 ± 11.43 years) or mild (n = 15; age 49.67 ± 7.30 years) disease and compared with age and sex-matched healthy adults (n = 59; age 50.49 ± 10.68 years). We assessed a broad range of immune cell phenotypes to generate a composite score, IMM-AGE, to determine the degree of immune senescence. We found increased immunesenescence features in severe COVID-19 survivors compared to controls including: a reduced frequency and number of naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells (p < 0.0001); increased frequency of EMRA CD4 (p < 0.003) and CD8 T cells (p < 0.001); a higher frequency (p < 0.0001) and absolute numbers (p < 0.001) of CD28−ve CD57+ve senescent CD4 and CD8 T cells; higher frequency (p < 0.003) and absolute numbers (p < 0.02) of PD-1 expressing exhausted CD8 T cells; a two-fold increase in Th17 polarisation (p < 0.0001); higher frequency of memory B cells (p < 0.001) and increased frequency (p < 0.0001) and numbers (p < 0.001) of CD57+ve senescent NK cells. As a result, the IMM-AGE score was significantly higher in severe COVID-19 survivors than in controls (p < 0.001). Few differences were seen for those with moderate disease and none for mild disease. Regression analysis revealed the only pre-existing variable influencing the IMM-AGE score was South Asian ethnicity (β = 0.174, p = 0.043), with a major influence being disease severity (β = 0.188, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our analyses reveal a state of enhanced immune ageing in survivors of severe COVID-19 and suggest this could be related to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Our data support the rationale for trials of anti-immune ageing interventions for improving clinical outcomes in these patients with severe disease.",10.1186/s12979-023-00406-z,MRC Versus Arthritis Centre for Musculoskeletal Ageing Research,0000-0002-8493-6687,56637773500.0,

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-8493-6687,56637773500.0,
Leigh Mary Morrison,Clinical characteristics with inflammation profiling of long COVID and association with 1-year recovery following hospitalisation in the UK: a prospective observational study,2022.0,The Lancet Respiratory Medicine,Article,"perceived recovery, recovery year, recovery, covid, recovery recovery, inflammation profiling, long covid, covid association, recovery assessed, characteristics inflammation","2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: No effective pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions exist for patients with long COVID. We aimed to describe recovery 1 year after hospital discharge for COVID-19, identify factors associated with patient-perceived recovery, and identify potential therapeutic targets by describing the underlying inflammatory profiles of the previously described recovery clusters at 5 months after hospital discharge. Methods: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruiting adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital with COVID-19 across the UK. Recovery was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, physical performance, and organ function at 5 months and 1 year after hospital discharge, and stratified by both patient-perceived recovery and recovery cluster. Hierarchical logistic regression modelling was performed for patient-perceived recovery at 1 year. Cluster analysis was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach using clinical outcomes at 5 months. Inflammatory protein profiling was analysed from plasma at the 5-month visit. This study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN10980107, and recruitment is ongoing. Findings: 2320 participants discharged from hospital between March 7, 2020, and April 18, 2021, were assessed at 5 months after discharge and 807 (32·7%) participants completed both the 5-month and 1-year visits. 279 (35·6%) of these 807 patients were women and 505 (64·4%) were men, with a mean age of 58·7 (SD 12·5) years, and 224 (27·8%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation (WHO class 7–9). The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was unchanged between 5 months (501 [25·5%] of 1965) and 1 year (232 [28·9%] of 804). Factors associated with being less likely to report full recovery at 1 year were female sex (odds ratio 0·68 [95% CI 0·46–0·99]), obesity (0·50 [0·34–0·74]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (0·42 [0·23–0·76]). Cluster analysis (n=1636) corroborated the previously reported four clusters: very severe, severe, moderate with cognitive impairment, and mild, relating to the severity of physical health, mental health, and cognitive impairment at 5 months. We found increased inflammatory mediators of tissue damage and repair in both the very severe and the moderate with cognitive impairment clusters compared with the mild cluster, including IL-6 concentration, which was increased in both comparisons (n=626 participants). We found a substantial deficit in median EQ-5D-5L utility index from before COVID-19 (retrospective assessment; 0·88 [IQR 0·74–1·00]), at 5 months (0·74 [0·64–0·88]) to 1 year (0·75 [0·62–0·88]), with minimal improvements across all outcome measures at 1 year after discharge in the whole cohort and within each of the four clusters. Interpretation: The sequelae of a hospital admission with COVID-19 were substantial 1 year after discharge across a range of health domains, with the minority in our cohort feeling fully recovered. Patient-perceived health-related quality of life was reduced at 1 year compared with before hospital admission. Systematic inflammation and obesity are potential treatable traits that warrant further investigation in clinical trials.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: COVID-19 is known to be associated with increased risks of cognitive and psychiatric outcomes after the acute phase of disease. We aimed to assess whether these symptoms can emerge or persist more than 1 year after hospitalisation for COVID-19, to identify which early aspects of COVID-19 illness predict longer-term symptoms, and to establish how these symptoms relate to occupational functioning. Methods: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) who were hospitalised with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 at participating National Health Service hospitals across the UK. In the C-Fog study, a subset of PHOSP-COVID participants who consented to be recontacted for other research were invited to complete a computerised cognitive assessment and clinical scales between 2 years and 3 years after hospital admission. Participants completed eight cognitive tasks, covering eight cognitive domains, from the Cognitron battery, in addition to the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale, and the 20-item Cognitive Change Index (CCI-20) questionnaire to assess subjective cognitive decline. We evaluated how the absolute risks of symptoms evolved between follow-ups at 6 months, 12 months, and 2–3 years, and whether symptoms at 2–3 years were predicted by earlier aspects of COVID-19 illness. Participants completed an occupation change questionnaire to establish whether their occupation or working status had changed and, if so, why. We assessed which symptoms at 2–3 years were associated with occupation change. People with lived experience were involved in the study. Findings: 2469 PHOSP-COVID participants were invited to participate in the C-Fog study, and 475 participants (191 [40·2%] females and 284 [59·8%] males; mean age 58·26 [SD 11·13] years) who were discharged from one of 83 hospitals provided data at the 2–3-year follow-up. Participants had worse cognitive scores than would be expected on the basis of their sociodemographic characteristics across all cognitive domains tested (average score 0·71 SD below the mean [IQR 0·16–1·04]; p<0·0001). Most participants reported at least mild depression (263 [74·5%] of 353), anxiety (189 [53·5%] of 353), fatigue (220 [62·3%] of 353), or subjective cognitive decline (184 [52·1%] of 353), and more than a fifth reported severe depression (79 [22·4%] of 353), fatigue (87 [24·6%] of 353), or subjective cognitive decline (88 [24·9%] of 353). Depression, anxiety, and fatigue were worse at 2–3 years than at 6 months or 12 months, with evidence of both worsening of existing symptoms and emergence of new symptoms. Symptoms at 2–3 years were not predicted by the severity of acute COVID-19 illness, but were strongly predicted by the degree of recovery at 6 months (explaining 35·0–48·8% of the variance in anxiety, depression, fatigue, and subjective cognitive decline); by a biocognitive profile linking acutely raised D-dimer relative to C-reactive protein with subjective cognitive deficits at 6 months (explaining 7·0–17·2% of the variance in anxiety, depression, fatigue, and subjective cognitive decline); and by anxiety, depression, fatigue, and subjective cognitive deficit at 6 months. Objective cognitive deficits at 2–3 years were not predicted by any of the factors tested, except for cognitive deficits at 6 months, explaining 10·6% of their variance. 95 of 353 participants (26·9% [95% CI 22·6–31·8]) reported occupational change, with poor health being the most common reason for this change. Occupation change was strongly and specifically associated with objective cognitive deficits (odds ratio [OR] 1·51 [95% CI 1·04–2·22] for every SD decrease in overall cognitive score) and subjective cognitive decline (OR 1·54 [1·21–1·98] for every point increase in CCI-20). Interpretation: Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms appear to increase over the first 2–3 years post-hospitalisation due to both worsening of symptoms already present at 6 months and emergence of new symptoms. New symptoms occur mostly in people with other symptoms already present at 6 months. Early identification and management of symptoms might therefore be an effective strategy to prevent later onset of a complex syndrome. Occupation change is common and associated mainly with objective and subjective cognitive deficits. Interventions to promote cognitive recovery or to prevent cognitive decline are therefore needed to limit the functional and economic impacts of COVID-19.

We investigated determinants of recovery from dyspnoea in adults with COVID-19 and compared these to determinants of recovery from non-COVID-19 dyspnoea. Methods: We used data from two prospective cohort studies: PHOSP-COVID (patients hospitalised between March 2020 and April 2021 with COVID-19) and COVIDENCE UK (community cohort studied over the same time period). PHOSP-COVID data were collected during hospitalisation and at 5-month and 1-year follow-up visits. COVIDENCE UK data were obtained through baseline and monthly online questionnaires. Dyspnoea was measured in both cohorts with the Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify determinants associated with a reduction in dyspnoea between 5-month and 1-year follow-up. Findings: We included 990 PHOSP-COVID and 3309 COVIDENCE UK participants. We observed higher odds of improvement between 5-month and 1-year follow-up among PHOSP-COVID participants who were younger (odds ratio 1.02 per year, 95% CI 1.01–1.03), male (1.54, 1.16–2.04), neither obese nor severely obese (1.82, 1.06–3.13 and 4.19, 2.14–8.19, respectively), had no pre-existing anxiety or depression (1.56, 1.09–2.22) or cardiovascular disease (1.33, 1.00–1.79), and shorter hospital admission (1.01 per day, 1.00–1.02). Similar associations were found in those recovering from non-COVID-19 dyspnoea, excluding age (and length of hospital admission). Interpretation: Factors associated with dyspnoea recovery at 1-year post-discharge among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were similar to those among community controls without COVID-19.

Leigh Mary Morrison,Effectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in prevention of hospitalisations and severe disease in adults with SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant between June 2021 and July 2022: A prospective test negative case–control study,2023.0,The Lancet Regional Health - Europe,Article,COVID-19; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; COVID-19; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Adult,"2022 The Author(s)Background: Whilst other studies have reported the effectiveness of mRNA vaccination against hospitalisation, including emergency department or intensive care admission, few have assessed effectiveness against other more clinically robust indices of COVID-19 severity. Methods: A prospective single-centre test-negative design case–control study of adults hospitalised with COVID-19 disease or other acute respiratory disease between 1 June 2021 and 20 July 2022. We assessed VE (vaccine effectiveness) against hospitalisation, length of stay [LOS] >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5 and supplementary oxygen FiO2 (fraction inspired oxygen) >28%, conducting regression analyses controlling for age, gender, index of multiple deprivation, Charlson comorbidity index, time, and community infection prevalence. Findings: 935 controls and 546 cases were hospitalised during the Delta period, with 721 controls and 372 cases hospitalised during the Omicron study period. Two-dose BNT162b2 was associated with VE 82.5% [95% confidence interval 76.2%–87.2%] against hospitalisation following Delta infection, 63.3% [26.9–81.8%], 58.5% [24.8–77.3%], and 51.5% [16.7–72.1%] against LOS >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5, and requirement for FiO2 >28% respectively. Three-dose BNT162b2 protection against hospitalisation with Omicron infection was 30.9% [5.9–49.3%], with sensitivity analyses ranging from 28.8–72.6%. Protection against LOS >3 days, WHO COVID Score >5 and requirement for FiO2 >28% was 56.1% [20.6–76.5%], 58.8% [31.2–75.8%], and 41.5% [−0.4–66.3%], respectively. In the UK, BNT162b2 was prioritised for high-risk individuals and those aged >75 years. In the latter group we found a higher estimate of VE against hospitalisation of 47.2% [16.8–66.6%]. Interpretation: BNT162b2 vaccination results in risk reductions for hospitalisation and multiple patient outcomes following Delta and Omicron COVID-19 infection, particularly in older adults.

Leigh Mary Morrison,"Effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID-19 vaccination at preventing hospitalisations in people aged at least 80 years: a test-negative, case-control study",2021.0,The Lancet Infectious Diseases,Article,Ear; Tin; Aged; Ear; Tin; Aged,"2021 Elsevier LtdBackground: On Dec 8, 2020, deployment of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination authorised for UK use (BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine) began, followed by an adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on Jan 4, 2021. Care home residents and staff, frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of advanced age. Methods: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care residency status. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 39557. Findings: Between Dec 18, 2020, and Feb 26, 2021, 466 adults were eligible (144 test-positive and 322 test-negative). 18 (13%) of 135 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 90 (34%) of 269 controls received one dose of BNT162b2. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71·4% (95% CI 46·5–90·6). Nine (25%) of 36 people with COVID-19 infection and 53 (59%) of 90 controls received one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 80·4% (95% CI 36·4–94·5). When BNT162b2 effectiveness analysis was restricted to the period covered by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the estimate was 79·3% (95% CI 47·0–92·5). Interpretation: One dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resulted in substantial risk reductions of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in people aged at least 80 years.

Leigh Mary Morrison,Effects of sleep disturbance on dyspnoea and impaired lung function following hospital admission due to COVID-19 in the UK: a prospective multicentre cohort study,2023.0,The Lancet Respiratory Medicine,Article,"sleep disturbance, quality sleep, effect sleep, dyspnoea impaired, impaired lung, disruption sleep, sleep quality, sleep, effects sleep","2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: Sleep disturbance is common following hospital admission both for COVID-19 and other causes. The clinical associations of this for recovery after hospital admission are poorly understood despite sleep disturbance contributing to morbidity in other scenarios. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and nature of sleep disturbance after discharge following hospital admission for COVID-19 and to assess whether this was associated with dyspnoea. Methods: CircCOVID was a prospective multicentre cohort substudy designed to investigate the effects of circadian disruption and sleep disturbance on recovery after COVID-19 in a cohort of participants aged 18 years or older, admitted to hospital for COVID-19 in the UK, and discharged between March, 2020, and October, 2021. Participants were recruited from the Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID). Follow-up data were collected at two timepoints: an early time point 2–7 months after hospital discharge and a later time point 10–14 months after hospital discharge. Sleep quality was assessed subjectively using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and a numerical rating scale. Sleep quality was also assessed with an accelerometer worn on the wrist (actigraphy) for 14 days. Participants were also clinically phenotyped, including assessment of symptoms (ie, anxiety [Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale questionnaire], muscle function [SARC-F questionnaire], dyspnoea [Dyspnoea-12 questionnaire] and measurement of lung function), at the early timepoint after discharge. Actigraphy results were also compared to a matched UK Biobank cohort (non-hospitalised individuals and recently hospitalised individuals). Multivariable linear regression was used to define associations of sleep disturbance with the primary outcome of breathlessness and the other clinical symptoms. PHOSP-COVID is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). Findings: 2320 of 2468 participants in the PHOSP-COVID study attended an early timepoint research visit a median of 5 months (IQR 4–6) following discharge from 83 hospitals in the UK. Data for sleep quality were assessed by subjective measures (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the numerical rating scale) for 638 participants at the early time point. Sleep quality was also assessed using device-based measures (actigraphy) a median of 7 months (IQR 5–8 months) after discharge from hospital for 729 participants. After discharge from hospital, the majority (396 [62%] of 638) of participants who had been admitted to hospital for COVID-19 reported poor sleep quality in response to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. A comparable proportion (338 [53%] of 638) of participants felt their sleep quality had deteriorated following discharge after COVID-19 admission, as assessed by the numerical rating scale. Device-based measurements were compared to an age-matched, sex-matched, BMI-matched, and time from discharge-matched UK Biobank cohort who had recently been admitted to hospital. Compared to the recently hospitalised matched UK Biobank cohort, participants in our study slept on average 65 min (95% CI 59 to 71) longer, had a lower sleep regularity index (–19%; 95% CI –20 to –16), and a lower sleep efficiency (3·83 percentage points; 95% CI 3·40 to 4·26). Similar results were obtained when comparisons were made with the non-hospitalised UK Biobank cohort. Overall sleep quality (unadjusted effect estimate 3·94; 95% CI 2·78 to 5·10), deterioration in sleep quality following hospital admission (3·00; 1·82 to 4·28), and sleep regularity (4·38; 2·10 to 6·65) were associated with higher dyspnoea scores. Poor sleep quality, deterioration in sleep quality, and sleep regularity were also associated with impaired lung function, as assessed by forced vital capacity. Depending on the sleep metric, anxiety mediated 18–39% of the effect of sleep disturbance on dyspnoea, while muscle weakness mediated 27–41% of this effect. Interpretation: Sleep disturbance following hospital admission for COVID-19 is associated with dyspnoea, anxiety, and muscle weakness. Due to the association with multiple symptoms, targeting sleep disturbance might be beneficial in treating the post-COVID-19 condition.

The severity of COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 aLRTD during this period have not been compared in detail. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults age ≥18 years admitted to either of two acute care hospitals in Bristol, UK, from August 2020 to November 2021. Patients were included if they presented with signs or symptoms of aLRTD (e.g., cough, pleurisy), or a clinical or radiological aLRTD diagnosis. Findings: 12,557 adult aLRTD hospitalisations occurred: 10,087 were associated with infection (pneumonia or non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection [NP-LRTI]), 2161 with no infective cause, with 306 providing a minimal surveillance dataset. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection accounted for 32% (3178/10,087) of respiratory infections. Annual incidences of overall, COVID-19, and non- SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were 714.1, 264.2, and 449.9, and NP-LRTI were 346.2, 43.8, and 302.4 per 100,000 adults, respectively. Weekly incidence trends in COVID-19 aLRTD showed large surges (median 6.5 [IQR 0.7–10.2] admissions per 100,000 adults per week), while other infective aLRTD events were more stable (median 14.3 [IQR 12.8–16.4] admissions per 100,000 adults per week) as were non-infective aLRTD events (median 4.4 [IQR 3.5–5.5] admissions per 100,000 adults per week). Interpretation: While COVID-19 disease was a large component of total aLRTD during this pandemic period, non- SARS-CoV-2 infection still caused the majority of respiratory infection hospitalisations. COVID-19 disease showed significant temporal fluctuations in frequency, which were less apparent in non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite public health interventions to reduce respiratory infection, disease incidence remains high.

Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: People hospitalised for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elevated incidence of diabetes. However, it is unclear whether this is due to shared risk factors, confounding or stress hyperglycaemia in response to acute illness. Methods: We analysed a multicentre prospective cohort study (PHOSP-COVID) of people ≥18 years discharged from NHS hospitals across the United Kingdom following COVID-19. Individuals were included if they attended at least one research visit with a HbA1c measurement within 14 months of discharge and had no history of diabetes at baseline. The primary outcome was new onset diabetes (any type), as defined by a first glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol). Follow-up was censored at the last HbA1c measurement. Age-standardised incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, length of hospital stay, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, deprivation, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia/hypercholesterolaemia, intensive therapy unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid use and C-reactive protein score) were calculated using Poisson regression. Incidence rates were compared with the control groups of published clinical trials in the United Kingdom by applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, where possible. Results: Incidence of diabetes was 91.4 per 1000 person-years and was higher in South Asian (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 3.60; 1.77, 7.32; p < 0.001) and Black ethnic groups (IRR = 2.36; 1.07, 5.21; p = 0.03) compared with White ethnic groups. When restricted to similar characteristics, the incidence rates were similar to those in UK clinical trials data. Conclusion: Diabetes incidence following hospitalisation for COVID-19 is high, but it remains uncertain whether it is disproportionately higher than pre-pandemic levels.",10.1111/dom.16071,College of Life Sciences,0000-0002-8493-6687,56637773500.0,

Elevated markers of myeloid inflammation and complement activation were associated with long COVID. IL-1R2, MATN2 and COLEC12 were associated with cardiorespiratory symptoms, fatigue and anxiety/depression; MATN2, CSF3 and C1QA were elevated in gastrointestinal symptoms and C1QA was elevated in cognitive impairment. Additional markers of alterations in nerve tissue repair (SPON-1 and NFASC) were elevated in those with cognitive impairment and SCG3, suggestive of brain–gut axis disturbance, was elevated in gastrointestinal symptoms. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) was persistently elevated in some individuals with long COVID, but virus was not detected in sputum. Analysis of inflammatory markers in nasal fluids showed no association with symptoms.

BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal College of Obstetricians and GynaecologistsObjective: To compare standard (native tissue) repair with synthetic mesh inlays or mesh kits. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-three UK hospitals. Population: Women having surgery for recurrent prolapse. Methods: Women recruited using remote randomisation. Main outcome measures: Prolapse symptoms, condition-specific quality-of-life and serious adverse effects. Results: A Mean Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score at 1 year was similar for each comparison (standard 6.6 versus mesh inlay 6.1, mean difference [MD] −0.41, 95% CI −2.92 to 2.11: standard 6.6 versus mesh kit 5.9, MD −1.21, 95% CI −4.13 to 1.72) but the confidence intervals did not exclude a minimally important clinical difference. There was no evidence of difference in any other outcome measure at 1 or 2 years. Serious adverse events, excluding mesh exposure, were similar at 1 year (standard 7/55 [13%] versus mesh inlay 5/52 [10%], risk ratio [RR] 1.05 [0.66–1.68]: standard 3/25 [12%] versus mesh kit 3/46 [7%], RR 0.49 [0.11–2.16]). Cumulative mesh exposure rates over 2 years were 7/52 (13%) in the mesh inlay arm, of whom four women required surgical revision; and 4/46 in the mesh kit arm (9%), of whom two required surgical revision. Conclusions: We did not find evidence of a difference in terms of prolapse symptoms from the use of mesh inlays or mesh kits in women undergoing repeat prolapse surgery.

Methods: In a prospective, UK-wide, multicentre MRI follow-up study (C-MORE), adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital following COVID-19 who were included in Tier 2 of the Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) and contemporary controls with no evidence of previous COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody negative) underwent multiorgan MRI (lungs, heart, brain, liver, and kidneys) with quantitative and qualitative assessment of images and clinical adjudication when relevant. Individuals with end-stage renal failure or contraindications to MRI were excluded. Participants also underwent detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical tests. The primary outcome was the excess burden of multiorgan abnormalities (two or more organs) relative to controls, with further adjustments for potential confounders. The C-MORE study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04510025. Findings: Of 2710 participants in Tier 2 of PHOSP-COVID, 531 were recruited across 13 UK-wide C-MORE sites. After exclusions, 259 C-MORE patients (mean age 57 years [SD 12]; 158 [61%] male and 101 [39%] female) who were discharged from hospital with PCR-confirmed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and Nov 1, 2021, and 52 non-COVID-19 controls from the community (mean age 49 years [SD 14]; 30 [58%] male and 22 [42%] female) were included in the analysis. Patients were assessed at a median of 5·0 months (IQR 4·2–6·3) after hospital discharge. Compared with non-COVID-19 controls, patients were older, living with more obesity, and had more comorbidities. Multiorgan abnormalities on MRI were more frequent in patients than in controls (157 [61%] of 259 vs 14 [27%] of 52; p<0·0001) and independently associated with COVID-19 status (odds ratio [OR] 2·9 [95% CI 1·5–5·8]; padjusted=0·0023) after adjusting for relevant confounders. Compared with controls, patients were more likely to have MRI evidence of lung abnormalities (p=0·0001; parenchymal abnormalities), brain abnormalities (p<0·0001; more white matter hyperintensities and regional brain volume reduction), and kidney abnormalities (p=0·014; lower medullary T1 and loss of corticomedullary differentiation), whereas cardiac and liver MRI abnormalities were similar between patients and controls. Patients with multiorgan abnormalities were older (difference in mean age 7 years [95% CI 4–10]; mean age of 59·8 years [SD 11·7] with multiorgan abnormalities vs mean age of 52·8 years [11·9] without multiorgan abnormalities; p<0·0001), more likely to have three or more comorbidities (OR 2·47 [1·32–4·82]; padjusted=0·0059), and more likely to have a more severe acute infection (acute CRP >5mg/L, OR 3·55 [1·23–11·88]; padjusted=0·025) than those without multiorgan abnormalities. Presence of lung MRI abnormalities was associated with a two-fold higher risk of chest tightness, and multiorgan MRI abnormalities were associated with severe and very severe persistent physical and mental health impairment (PHOSP-COVID symptom clusters) after hospitalisation. Interpretation: After hospitalisation for COVID-19, people are at risk of multiorgan abnormalities in the medium term. Our findings emphasise the need for proactive multidisciplinary care pathways, with the potential for imaging to guide surveillance frequency and therapeutic stratification.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes. Methods: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107). Findings: We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between March 5 and Nov 30, 2020, who underwent assessment at a median of 5·9 months (IQR 4·9–6·5) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of white ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least two comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40–59 years), two or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n=767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, nine (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity. Interpretation: We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (eg, female sex, middle age, two or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and four different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments were closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.

Methods: This prospective cohort study recruited adults who had survived hospitalisation with clinically diagnosed COVID-19 across 35 sites in the UK (PHOSP-COVID). The burden of frailty was objectively measured using Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FFP). The primary outcome was the prevalence of each FFP group—robust (no FFP criteria), pre-frail (one or two FFP criteria) and frail (three or more FFP criteria)—at 5 months and 1 year after discharge from hospital. For inclusion in the primary analysis, participants required complete outcome data for three of the five FFP criteria. Longitudinal changes across frailty domains are reported at 5 months and 1 year post-hospitalisation, along with risk factors for frailty status. Patient-perceived recovery and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were retrospectively rated for pre-COVID-19 and prospectively rated at the 5 month and 1 year visits. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN10980107. Findings: Between March 5, 2020, and March 31, 2021, 2419 participants were enrolled with FFP data. Mean age was 57.9 (SD 12.6) years, 933 (38.6%) were female, and 429 (17.7%) had received invasive mechanical ventilation. 1785 had measures at both timepoints, of which 240 (13.4%), 1138 (63.8%) and 407 (22.8%) were frail, pre-frail and robust, respectively, at 5 months compared with 123 (6.9%), 1046 (58.6%) and 616 (34.5%) at 1 year. Factors associated with pre-frailty or frailty were invasive mechanical ventilation, older age, female sex, and greater social deprivation. Frail participants had a larger reduction in HRQoL compared with before their COVID-19 illness and were less likely to describe themselves as recovered. Interpretation: Physical frailty and pre-frailty are common following hospitalisation with COVID-19. Improvement in frailty was seen between 5 and 12 months although two-thirds of the population remained pre-frail or frail. This suggests comprehensive assessment and interventions targeting pre-frailty and frailty beyond the initial illness are required.

Leigh Mary Morrison,SARS-CoV-2-specific nasal IgA wanes 9 months after hospitalisation with COVID-19 and is not induced by subsequent vaccination,2023.0,eBioMedicine,Article,Convalescent; COVID-19; Mucosal immunity; Nasal antibody; SARS-CoV-2 immunity; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Vaccination; Convalescent; COVID-19; Mucosal immunity; Nasal antibody; SARS-CoV-2 immunity; SARS-CoV-2 variants; Vaccination,"2022 The Author(s)Background: Most studies of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 focus on circulating antibody, giving limited insights into mucosal defences that prevent viral replication and onward transmission. We studied nasal and plasma antibody responses one year after hospitalisation for COVID-19, including a period when SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was introduced. Methods: In this follow up study, plasma and nasosorption samples were prospectively collected from 446 adults hospitalised for COVID-19 between February 2020 and March 2021 via the ISARIC4C and PHOSP-COVID consortia. IgA and IgG responses to NP and S of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Delta and Omicron (BA.1) variants were measured by electrochemiluminescence and compared with plasma neutralisation data. Findings: Strong and consistent nasal anti-NP and anti-S IgA responses were demonstrated, which remained elevated for nine months (p < 0.0001). Nasal and plasma anti-S IgG remained elevated for at least 12 months (p < 0.0001) with plasma neutralising titres that were raised against all variants compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Of 323 with complete data, 307 were vaccinated between 6 and 12 months; coinciding with rises in nasal and plasma IgA and IgG anti-S titres for all SARS-CoV-2 variants, although the change in nasal IgA was minimal (1.46-fold change after 10 months, p = 0.011) and the median remained below the positive threshold determined by pre-pandemic controls. Samples 12 months after admission showed no association between nasal IgA and plasma IgG anti-S responses (R = 0.05, p = 0.18), indicating that nasal IgA responses are distinct from those in plasma and minimally boosted by vaccination. Interpretation: The decline in nasal IgA responses 9 months after infection and minimal impact of subsequent vaccination may explain the lack of long-lasting nasal defence against reinfection and the limited effects of vaccination on transmission. These findings highlight the need to develop vaccines that enhance nasal immunity. Funding: This study has been supported by ISARIC4C and PHOSP-COVID consortia.

Leigh Mary Morrison,"Severity of Omicron (B.1.1.529) and Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospitalised adults: A prospective cohort study in Bristol, United Kingdom",2023.0,The Lancet Regional Health - Europe,Article,COVID-19; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; COVID-19; Respiratory infection; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Infection; Adult; United Kingdom,"2022 The Author(s)Background: There is an urgent public health need to evaluate disease severity in adults hospitalised with Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant infections. However, limited data exist assessing severity of disease in adults hospitalised with Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infections, and to what extent patient-factors, including vaccination, age, frailty and pre-existing disease, affect variant-dependent disease severity. Methods: A prospective cohort study of adults (≥18 years of age) hospitalised with acute lower respiratory tract disease at acute care hospitals in Bristol, UK conducted over 10-months. Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and variant identification or inferred by dominant circulating variant. We constructed adjusted regression analyses to assess disease severity using three different measures: FiO2 >28% (fraction inspired oxygen), World Health Organization (WHO) outcome score >5 (assessing need for ventilatory support), and hospital length of stay (LOS) >3 days following admission for Omicron or Delta infection. Findings: Independent of other variables, including vaccination, Omicron variant infection in hospitalised adults was associated with lower severity than Delta. Risk reductions were 58%, 67%, and 16% for supplementary oxygen with >28% FiO2 [Relative Risk (RR) = 0.42 (95%CI: 0.34–0.52), P < 0.001], WHO outcome score >5 [RR = 0.33 (95%CI: 0.21–0.50), P < 0.001], and to have had a LOS > 3 days [RR = 0.84 (95%CI: 0.76–0.92), P < 0.001]. Younger age and vaccination with two or three doses were also independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity. Interpretation: We provide reassuring evidence that Omicron infection results in less serious adverse outcomes than Delta in hospitalised patients. Despite lower severity relative to Delta, Omicron infection still resulted in substantial patient and public health burden and an increased admission rate of older patients with Omicron which counteracts some of the benefit arising from less severe disease.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the standard operation for benign prostatic obstruction. Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) is a technique with suggested advantages over TURP, including reduced complications and hospital stay. We aimed to investigate TURP versus ThuVARP in men with lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction. Methods: In this randomised, blinded, parallel-group, pragmatic equivalence trial, men in seven UK hospitals with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction were randomly assigned (1:1) at the point of surgery to receive ThuVARP or TURP. Patients were masked until follow-up completion. Centres used their usual TURP procedure (monopolar or bipolar). All trial surgeons underwent training on the ThuVARP technique. Co-primary outcomes were maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12-months post-surgery. Equivalence was defined as a difference of 2·5 points or less for IPSS and 4 mL per s or less for Qmax. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN00788389. Findings: Between July 23, 2014, and Dec 30, 2016, 410 men were randomly assigned to ThuVARP or TURP, 205 per study group. TURP was superior for Qmax (mean 23·2 mL per s for TURP and 20·2 mL per s for ThuVARP; adjusted difference in means −3·12, 95% CI −5·79 to −0·45). Equivalence was shown for IPSS (mean 6·3 for TURP and 6·4 for ThuVARP; adjusted difference in means 0·28, −0·92 to 1·49). Mean hospital stay was 48 h in both study groups. 91 (45%) of 204 patients in the TURP group and 96 (47%) of 203 patients in the ThuVARP group had at least one complication. Interpretation: TURP and ThuVARP were equivalent for urinary symptom improvement (IPSS) 12-months post-surgery, and TURP was superior for Qmax. Anticipated laser benefits for ThuVARP of reduced hospital stay and complications were not observed.

Leigh Mary Morrison,Use of illness severity scores to predict mortality in interstitial lung disease patients hospitalised with acute respiratory deterioration,2023.0,Respiratory Medicine,Article,Acute respiratory deterioration; Interstitial lung disease; Pulmonary fibrosis; Severity scores; Acute respiratory deterioration; Interstitial lung disease; Pulmonary fibrosis; Severity scores,"2023 The AuthorsIntroduction: Hospitalisations relating to acute respiratory deteriorations (ARD) in Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) have poor outcomes. Factors predicting adverse outcomes are not fully understood and data addressing the use of illness severity scores in prognostication are limited. Objective: To investigate the use of CURB-65 and NEWS-2 severity scores in the prediction of mortality following ARD-ILD hospitalisation, using prospective methodology and to validate previously determined cut-offs, derived from a retrospective study cohort. Methods: A dual-centre prospective observational cohort study of all adults (≥18y) hospitalised with ARD-ILD in Bristol, UK (n = 179). Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP), CURB-65 and NEWS-2 scores were calculated for each eligible admission. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to quantify the strength of discrimination for NEWS-2 and CURB-65 scores. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between baseline severity scores and mortality. Results: GAP showed some merit at predicting 30-day mortality (AUC = 0.64, P = 0.015); whereas CURB-65 showed modest predictive value for in-hospital (AUC = 0.72, P < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (AUC = 0.67, P < 0.001). NEWS-2 showed higher predictive value for in-hospital (AUC = 0.80, P < 0.001) and 90-day mortality (AUC = 0.75, P < 0.001), with an optimal derived cut-off ≥6.5 found to be sensitive and specific for predicting in-hospital (83% and 63%) and 90-day (73% and 72%) mortality. In exploratory analyses, GAP score addition improved the predictive ability of NEWS-2 against 30-day mortality and CURB-65 across all time-periods. Conclusion: NEWS-2 has good discriminatory value for predicting in-hospital mortality and moderate discriminatory value for predicting 90-day mortality. The optimal NEWS-2 cut-off value determined was the same as in a previous retrospective cohort, confirming the NEWS-2 score shows promise in predicting mortality following ARD-ILD hospitalisation.",10.1016/j.rmed.2023.107220,Bristol Medical School,0000-0002-8493-6687,56637773500.0,

To assess these impacts, we surveyed youth regarding their experiences with, and perspectives on, the long-term effects of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a nationwide text message survey of youth ages 14–24 years in the United States. The survey asked four open ended questions regarding their experiences and perceptions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19. Qualitative data was analyzed independently by three investigators using thematic analysis. Prevalence of codes were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: Among 1150 participants, 991 responded to at least one survey question (response rate 86.1%). The vast majority of our sample had COVID-19 or knew someone who did (75%), and approximately one third (32%) of youth indicated that they knew someone who had experienced symptoms consistent with Long Covid. Many youth (50%) reported worry and concern about Long Covid even if they, or someone they knew, did not have Long Covid. Among youth who were not concerned about Long Covid, the most commonly reported reasons were having received the vaccine (29%) and not having a prior COVID-19 infection (24%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that among younger populations, there is significant concern regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19. Vaccination campaigns and youth-centered public health communication about Long Covid may not only reduce COVID-19 transmission, but also alleviate worries and concerns about Long Covid among youth.",10.1186/s12889-023-16899-8,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-8493-6687,56637773500.0,

Although systemic barriers and their adverse effects on medical student performance are well documented, few studies include disabled students' first-person accounts. Existing first-person accounts are limited by their focus predominantly on students who used accommodations. This study bridged these gaps by analyzing a national dataset of medical students with disabilities to understand their perceptions of disability inclusion in U.S. medical education. Method The authors analyzed 674 open-text responses by students with disabilities from the 2019 and 2020 Association of American Medical Colleges Year Two Questionnaire responding to the prompt, ""Use the space below if you would like to share anything about your experiences regarding disability and medical school.""Following reflexive thematic analysis principles, the authors coded the data using an inductive semantic approach to develop and refine themes. The authors used the political-relational model of disability to interpret themes. Results Student responses were wide-ranging in experience. The authors identified key dimensions of the medical education system that influenced student experiences: program structure, processes, people, and culture. These dimensions informed the changes students perceived as possible to support their access to education and whether pursuing such change would be acceptable. In turn, students took action to navigate the system, using administrative, social, and internal mechanisms to manage disability. Conclusions Key dimensions of medical school affect student experiences of and interactions with disability inclusion, demonstrating the political-relational production of disability. Findings confirm earlier studies on disability inclusion that suggest systemic change is necessary, while adding depth to understand how and why students do not pursue accommodations. On the basis of student accounts, the authors identify existing resources to help medical schools remedy deficits in their systems to improve their disability inclusion practice.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000005842,Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences,0000-0002-3647-3657,56901065100.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: Ensuring access to accommodations is critical for resident physicians and their patients. Studies show that a large proportion of medical trainees with disabilities do not request needed accommodations; however, drivers of nonrequests are unknown. Objective: To assess the frequency of accommodation requests among first-year resident physicians (ie, interns) with disabilities and to identify possible drivers of nonrequest for needed accommodations. Design, Setting, and Participants: As part of the Intern Health Study, a longitudinal cohort study of first-year resident physicians, residents at 86 surgical and nonsurgical residency programs in 64 US institutions provided demographic and training characteristics 2 months prior to matriculation (April-May 2021). At the end of their intern year (June 2022), participants completed a new survey with questions about disability-related information, including disability status, disability type, whether they received accommodations, and if not, reasons for nonaccommodation. Poststratification and attrition weights were used to estimate the frequency of accommodation requests and reasons for not requesting accommodations. Interns reporting at least 1 disability were included in the analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of reported disabilities, residency specialties distribution, frequency of accommodation requests, and reasons for nonaccommodation among resident physicians with disabilities. Results: Among the 1486 resident physicians who completed the baseline survey, 799 (53.8%) replied to the disability questions. Of those, 94 interns (11.8%; weighted number, 173 [11.9%]) reported at least 1 disability and were included in the present study (weighted numbers, 91 [52.6%] men, 82 [47.4%] women, mean [SD] age, 28.6 [3.0] years). Among interns with reported disability and need for accommodations (83 of 173 [48.0%]), more than half (42 [50.6%]) did not request them. The most frequently reported reasons for not requesting needed accommodations were fear of stigma or bias (25 [59.5%]), lack of a clear institutional process for requesting accommodations (10 [23.8%]), and lack of documentation (5 [11.9%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Program directors should investigate cultural and structural factors within their programs that contribute to an environment where residents do not feel safe or supported in disclosing disability and requesting accommodation and review their disability policies for clarity..",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.9981,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3647-3657,56901065100.0,

Indeed, disability inclusion is experiencing a renaissance in medical education. However, the philosophy of disability inclusion must be adjusted from one where disabled trainees are viewed as problematic and having to ‘overcome’ disability to one where institutions anticipate and welcome disabled trainees as a normative part of a diverse community. Observations: Most trainees with disabilities will enter an unregulated, uninformed system leaving them vulnerable to under-accommodation, systems barriers and lack of informed support. Further, the perception of the super human good doctor creates disincentives for candidates to disclose their disability, creating structural barriers that the system needs to address. A less often discussed contributor to health care inequities is the inadequate training of health professional educators on disability rights and disability competencies. Indeed, the lack of education, coupled with minimal exposure to disability outside of the hierarchical patient-provider relationship, perpetuates to stereotypes and biases that impact clinical care. Approach: Disability inclusion has not been reviewed through the lens of quality improvement. To close this gap, we examine the state of the science through the lens of disability inclusion and offer considerations for a quality improvement approach in medical education that addresses the global revised trilogy of World Federation for Medical Education standards of quality improvement at all three levels of education, training and practice. Conclusion: We propose a vision of systems-based disability-inclusive, accessible and equitable medical education using 9 of Deming's 14 points as applicable to medical education.",10.1111/medu.14878,University College of Medical Sciences,0000-0002-3647-3657,56901065100.0,

Medical Education published by Association for the Study of Medical Education and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate whether self-disclosed disability and self-reported program access are associated with measures of empathy and burnout in a national sample of US medical students. Methods: The authors obtained data from students who responded to the Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) Year 2 Questionnaire (Y2Q) in 2019 and 2020. Data included demographic characteristics, personal variables, learning environment indicators, measures of burnout (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory for Medical Students), empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) and disability-related questions, including self-reported disability, disability category and program access. Associations between disability status, program access, empathy and burnout were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models accounting for YQ2 demographic, personal-related and learning environment measures. Results: Overall, 23 898 (54.2%) provided disability data and were included. Of those, 2438 (10.2%) self-reported a disability. Most medical students with disabilities (SWD) self-reported having program access through accommodations (1215 [49.8%]) or that accommodations were not required for access (824 [33.8%]). Multivariable models identified that compared with students without disabilities, SWD with and without program access presented higher odds of high exhaustion (1.50 [95% CI, 1.34–1.69] and 2.59 [95% CI, 1.93–3.49], respectively) and lower odds of low empathy (0.75 [95% CI, 0.67–.85] and 0.68 [95% CI, 0.52–0.90], respectively). In contrast, multivariable models for disengagement identified that SWD reporting lack of program access presented higher odds of high disengagement compared to students without disabilities (1.43 [95% CI, 1.09–1.87], whereas SWD with program access did not (1.09 [95% CI, 0.97–1.22]). Conclusions: Despite higher odds of high exhaustion, SWD were less likely to present low empathy regardless of program access, and SWD with program access did not differ from students without disabilities in terms of disengagement. These findings add to our understanding of the characteristics and experiences of SWD including their contributions as empathic future physicians.",10.1111/medu.14995,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3647-3657,56901065100.0,
Lisa Meeks,Exploring accommodations along the education to employment pathway for deaf and hard of hearing healthcare professionals,2022.0,BMC Medical Education,Article,Deafness; Disability; Diversity; Medical education; Deafness; Disability; Diversity; Medical education,"2022, The Author(s).Background: Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people are an underserved population and underrepresented among healthcare professionals. A major barrier to success for DHH healthcare professionals is obtaining effective accommodations during education and employment. Our objective: describe DHH individuals’ experiences with accommodations in healthcare education. Methods: We used an online survey and multipronged snowball sampling to recruit participants who identify as DHH and who had applied to a U.S. health professional school (regardless of acceptance status). One hundred forty-eight individuals representing multiple professions responded; 51 had completed their training. Over 80% had been accepted to, were currently enrolled, or had completed health professions schools or residency programs, and/or were employed. The survey included questions addressing experiences applying to health professions programs and employment; satisfaction with accommodations in school and training; having worked with a disability resource professional (DRP); and depression screening. Results: Use and type of accommodation varied widely. While in school, respondents reported spending a mean of 2.1 h weekly managing their accommodations. Only 50% were highly satisfied with the accommodations provided by their programs. Use of disability resource providers (DRPs) for accommodations was highest during school (56%) and less frequent during post-graduate training (20%) and employment (14%). Respondents who transitioned directly from school to employment (versus via additional training) were more satisfied with their accommodations during school and were more likely to find employment (p = 0.02). Seventeen respondents screened positive for risk of depression; a positive screen was statistically associated with lower school accommodation satisfaction. Conclusions: DHH people study and practice across many health professions. While respondents were mostly successful in entering health professions programs, accommodation experiences and satisfaction varied. Satisfaction with accommodations was related to successful employment and wellness. Low satisfaction was associated with higher likelihood of depression symptoms. To increase representation in the workforce, healthcare professional schools, training programs, and employers should enhance support for the learning and working climates for people with disabilities.",10.1186/s12909-022-03403-w,Dell Medical School,0000-0002-3647-3657,56901065100.0,
Lisa Meeks,Informed Inclusion Model: Medical Student Wheelchair User in an Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship,2024.0,Academic Medicine,Article,Heel; Hip; Hair; Ecology; Obstetrics,"Copyright © 2024 the Association of American Medical Colleges.Students with physical disabilities are underrepresented in medicine, driven in part by ableist beliefs about the ability of individuals with disabilities to complete procedure-based or surgically oriented clerkships, including obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn). There is a growing commitment to disability inclusion by medical and specialty training associations. Yet published case studies and accommodation protocols for medical student wheelchair users navigating an Ob/Gyn clerkship are absent in the literature. This article describes successful disability inclusion for an Ob/Gyn clerkship, including accommodations for medical student wheelchair users. The authors share mechanisms to address and combat ableist assumptions and facilitate access for future medical students by working collaboratively with student and key stakeholders to develop an inclusive and accessible training experience. These recommendations are shared through the story of a third-year medical student who rotated through the longitudinal clerkships at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. The student, an individual with osteogenesis imperfecta who uses a power wheelchair with a seat elevator, completed third-year rotations and thrived in her clinical experiences. The authors describe her journey through a robust 4-week Ob/Gyn clerkship, in which she fulfilled the required clinical core conditions and observation skills with reasonable accommodation. Given the high acuity, surgery, and outpatient demands in Ob/Gyn - and the transferrable skills to other clerkships - the student's experience is an excellent exemplar for demonstrating disability inclusion and reasonable accommodation. Ob/Gyn clerkship directors and clinical faculty can broadly use the recommended timelines and communication protocols to create accessible training environments. With student input, minor scheduling adjustments, ongoing communication, reasonable accommodations, and an open mind, medical students on the clinical wards who are wheelchair users can successfully navigate the required expectations of medical training.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000005743,CASE School of Medicine,0000-0002-3647-3657,56901065100.0,

Ableism within medical training and practice diminishes physician diversity and wellbeing and contributes to healthcare disparities. Objective: Explore physician barriers to disability equity and inclusion by examining internal medicine (IM) program directors’ (PD) perspectives about recruiting and accommodating residents with disabilities (RWD). Design: Qualitative study involving semi-structured virtual interviews (conducted December 2022–September 2023; analyzed through December 2023). Participants: PDs were recruited via email.

Key Results: Of the 15 programs represented, 4 had ≤ 49 and 8 had ≥ 100 total residents. Three were community-based; the rest had academic affiliations. On average, PDs had 17 (SD 8.2) years in practice. Most (11/15) identified as White race; 8/15 as female; and none as disabled. PDs characterized disability as a source of grit and empathy but also as an intrinsic deficit. They worried RWDs could have unpredictable absences and clinical incompetencies.

However, the increase in representation among people with physical disabilities remains low, and published case studies and accommodations processes for wheelchair users in pediatric residency are absent in the literature. To support the inclusion of residents with physical disabilities in residency, we outline a proactive approach to the accommodations process and inclusion of a resident with a physical disability in pediatric residency. Methods: A multidisciplinary team, including residency program leadership, disability professionals, the hospital system, and the resident, developed and implemented reasonable accommodations for a resident wheelchair user entering pediatric residency utilizing an iterative and interactive process. Results: A pediatric resident wheelchair user completed residency training and specialty requirements utilizing reasonable accommodations.

All rights reserved.Background: Digital behavioral interventions have become increasingly popular for their ability to support patient diagnosis and treatment, chronic disease self-management, behavior change, and adherence to recommended care. However, digital intervention development is impeded by challenges such as limited technical skills, limited access to developers, and cost. The purpose of this study is to elicit in-depth qualitative feedback from intervention developers who have interest in digital behavioral interventions but lack programming skills regarding the barriers they experience and key considerations in the design and implementation of digital interventions. Objective: This study aims to understand barriers in the design and implementation of digital behavioral interventions, as well as to identify key considerations for researchers who are developing these interventions. Methods: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience either designing (but not coding) digital behavioral interventions or running research studies with them. Participants were a convenience sample of users of the Computerized Intervention Authoring System platform, an existing no-code development platform for building digital intervention content, and were recruited through either direct email solicitation or snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted and recorded over videoconference between February and April 2020. Recordings from interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders. Results: Interviews were completed with 18 participants and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, SD 11.3) minutes. Interviewees were predominantly female (17/18, 94%) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to project/study staff. Three key barriers in the development of digital behavior interventions were identified during interviews: lack of cross-disciplinary understanding; variability in recipients’ technology access, infrastructure, and literacy; and the idea that evidence-based in-person interactions do not translate directly to digital interactions. Interviewees identified several key considerations that interventionists learned to prioritize, which have the potential to overcome these barriers and lead to successful interventions. Conclusions: Barriers in the development of digital behavioral interventions are often created by a lack of cross-disciplinary understanding, which can lead to difficulties conceptualizing interventions, unrealistic expectations in terms of cost, and confusion about the development process. Moreover, concerns about research study participant characteristics and access to technology, as well as the translation of in-person interventions to digital, are apparent. Appropriate training in how to work with software development teams may help future digital behavior intervention creators overcome these barriers and may lead to new, exciting innovations in this space.",10.2196/34301,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0

All rights reserved.Background: Remote blood pressure (BP) monitoring (RBPM) or BP telemonitoring is beneficial in hypertension management. People with hypertension involved in telemonitoring of BP often have better BP control than those in usual care. However, most reports on RBPM are from intervention studies. Objective: This study aimed to assess participant characteristics and technology health behaviors associated with RBPM participation in a wider population with hypertension. This study will help us understand the predictors of RBPM participation and consider how to increase it. Methods: This was a quantitative, cross-sectional survey study of people with hypertension in the United States. The inclusion criteria included people aged ≥18 years with a hypertension diagnosis or who self-reported they have hypertension, had a prescription of at least one hypertension medication, understood the English language, and were willing to participate. The survey included demographics, technology health behaviors, and RBPM participation questions. The survey was selfadministered on the Qualtrics platform and followed the CHERRIES (Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys) checklist. The primary dependent variable was participation in RBPM. Results: In total, 507 people with hypertension participated in the survey. The mean age for all respondents was 60 (SD 14.7) years. The respondents were mostly female (306/507, 60.4%), non-Hispanic (483/507, 95.3%), and White (429/507, 84.6%). A little over half of the respondents reported having had hypertension for 5 years or more (287/507, 56.6%). About one-third of participants were aware of RBPM (165/507, 32.5%), and 11.8% (60/507) were enrolled in RBPM. The mean age of those engaging in RBPM and non-RBPM was 46.2 (SD 14.7) and 62 (SD 13.7) years, respectively. The most common reasons for not participating in RBPM were because their health provider did not ask the participant to participate (247/447, 55.3%) and their lack of awareness of RBPM (190/447, 42.5%). Most respondents in the RBPM group measure their BP at home (55/60, 91.7%), and 61.7% (37/60) engage in daily BP measurement, compared with 62.6% (280/447) and 25.1% (112/447), respectively, among the non-RBPM group. A greater number of those in the RBPM group reported tracking their BP measurements with mobile health (mHealth; 37/60, 61.7%) than those in the non-RBPM group (70/447, 15.6%). The electronic health records or patient portal was the most common channel of RBPM communication between the respondents and their health care providers. The significant predictors of participation in RBPM were RBPM awareness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 34.65, 95% CI 11.35-150.31; P<.001) and sharing health information electronically with a health provider (AOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.39-21.64; P=.01) among all participants. However, the significant predictor of participation in RBPM among participants who were aware of RBPM was sharing health information electronically with a health provider (AOR 6.99, 95% CI 1.62-47.44; P=.007). Conclusions: Participation in RBPM is likely to increase with increased awareness, health providers' recommendations, and tailoring RBPM services to patients' preferred electronic communication channels.",10.2196/56954,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

The use of user-friendly continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) with low-carbohydrate diet coaching is a novel strategy to prevent T2DM. Objective: This study aims to determine the patient satisfaction and feasibility of an intervention combining CGM use and low-carbohydrate diet coaching in patients with prediabetes to drive dietary behavior change. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods, single-arm pilot and feasibility study at a suburban family medicine clinic. A total of 15 adults with prediabetes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels between 5.7% and 6.4% and a BMI >30 kg/m2 were recruited to participate. The intervention and assessments took place during 3 in-person study visits and 2 qualitative phone interviews (3 weeks and 6 months after the intervention). During visit 1, participants were asked to wear a CGM and complete a food intake and craving log for 10 days. During visit 2, the food intake and craving log along with the CGM results of the participants were reviewed and the participants received low-carbohydrate diet coaching, including learning about carbohydrates and personalized feedback. A second CGM sensor, with the ability to scan and record glucose trends, was placed, and the participants logged their food intake and cravings as they attempted to reduce their total carbohydrate intake (<100 g/day). During visit 3, the participants reviewed their CGM and log data. The primary outcome was satisfaction with the use of CGM and low-carbohydrate diet. The secondary outcomes included feasibility, weight, and HbA1c change, and percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia. Changes in attitudes and risk perception of developing diabetes were also assessed. Results: The overall satisfaction rate of our intervention was 93%. The intervention induced a weight reduction of 1.4 lb (P=.02) and a reduction of HbA1c levels by 0.71% (P<.001) since enrollment. Although not significantly, the percentage of time above glucose goal and average daily glucose levels decreased slightly during the study period. Qualitative interview themes indicated no major barriers to CGM use; the acceptance of a low-carbohydrate diet; and that CGMs helped to visualize the impact of carbohydrates on the body, driving dietary changes. Conclusions: The use of CGMs and low-carbohydrate diet coaching to drive dietary changes in patients with prediabetes is feasible and acceptable to patients. This novel method merits further exploration, as the preliminary data indicate that combining CGM use with low-carbohydrate diet coaching drives dietary changes, which may ultimately prevent T2DM.",10.2196/21551,,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Though maintaining physical conditioning and a healthy weight are requirements of active military duty, many US veterans lose conditioning and rapidly gain weight after discharge from active duty service. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions using wearable devices are appealing to users and can be effective especially with personalized coaching support. We developed Stay Strong, a mobile app tailored to US veterans, to promote physical activity using a wrist-worn physical activity tracker, a Bluetooth-enabled scale, and an app-based dashboard. We tested whether adding personalized coaching components (Stay Strong+Coaching) would improve physical activity compared to Stay Strong alone. Objective: The goal of this study is to compare 12-month outcomes from Stay Strong alone versus Stay Strong+Coaching. Methods: Participants (n=357) were recruited from a national random sample of US veterans of recent wars and randomly assigned to the Stay Strong app alone (n=179) or Stay Strong+Coaching (n=178); both programs lasted 12 months. Personalized coaching components for Stay Strong+Coaching comprised of automated in-app motivational messages (3 per week), telephone-based human health coaching (up to 3 calls), and personalized weekly goal setting. All aspects of the enrollment process and program delivery were accomplished virtually for both groups, except for the telephone-based coaching. The primary outcome was change in physical activity at 12 months postbaseline, measured by average weekly Active Minutes, captured by the Fitbit Charge 2 device. Secondary outcomes included changes in step counts, weight, and patient activation. Results: The average age of participants was 39.8 (SD 8.7) years, and 25.2% (90/357) were female. Active Minutes decreased from baseline to 12 months for both groups (P<.001) with no between-group differences at 6 months (P=.82) or 12 months (P=.98). However, at 12 months, many participants in both groups did not record Active Minutes, leading to missing data in 67.0% (120/179) for Stay Strong and 61.8% (110/178) for Stay Strong+Coaching. Average baseline weight for participants in Stay Strong and Stay Strong+Coaching was 214 lbs and 198 lbs, respectively, with no difference at baseline (P=.54) or at 6 months (P=.28) or 12 months (P=.18) postbaseline based on administrative weights, which had lower rates of missing data. Changes in the number of steps recorded and patient activation also did not differ by arm. Conclusions: Adding personalized health coaching comprised of in-app automated messages, up to 3 coaching calls, plus automated weekly personalized goals, did not improve levels of physical activity compared to using a smartphone app alone. Physical activity in both groups decreased over time. Sustaining long-term adherence and engagement in this mHealth intervention proved difficult; approximately two-thirds of the trial's 357 participants failed to sync their Fitbit device at 12 months and, thus, were lost to follow-up.",10.2196/19216,VA Medical Center,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

Originally published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth (https://mhealth.jmir.org).Background: Hypertension, a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is more prevalent among Black and low-income individuals. To address this health disparity, leveraging safety-net emergency departments for scalable mobile health (mHealth) interventions, specifically using text messaging for self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring, presents a promising strategy. This study investigates patterns of engagement, associated factors, and the impact of engagement on lowering blood pressure (BP) in an underserved population. Objective: We aimed to identify patterns of engagement with prompted SMBP monitoring with feedback, factors associated with engagement, and the association of engagement with lowered BP. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from Reach Out, an mHealth, factorial trial among 488 hypertensive patients recruited from a safety-net emergency department in Flint, Michigan. Reach Out participants were randomized to weekly or daily text message prompts to measure their BP and text in their responses. Engagement was defined as a BP response to the prompt. The k-means clustering algorithm and visualization were used to determine the pattern of SMBP engagement by SMBP prompt frequency-weekly or daily. BP was remotely measured at 12 months. For each prompt frequency group, logistic regression models were used to assess the univariate association of demographics, access to care, and comorbidities with high engagement. We then used linear mixed-effects models to explore the association between engagement and systolic BP at 12 months, estimated using average marginal effects. Results: For both SMBP prompt groups, the optimal number of engagement clusters was 2, which we defined as high and low engagement. Of the 241 weekly participants, 189 (78.4%) were low (response rate: mean 20%, SD 23.4) engagers, and 52 (21.6%) were high (response rate: mean 86%, SD 14.7) engagers. Of the 247 daily participants, 221 (89.5%) were low engagers (response rate: mean 9%, SD 12.2), and 26 (10.5%) were high (response rate: mean 67%, SD 8.7) engagers. Among weekly participants, those who were older (>65 years of age), attended some college (vs no college), married or lived with someone, had Medicare (vs Medicaid), were under the care of a primary care doctor, and took antihypertensive medication in the last 6 months had higher odds of high engagement. Participants who lacked transportation to appointments had lower odds of high engagement. In both prompt frequency groups, participants who were high engagers had a greater decline in BP compared to low engagers. Conclusions: Participants randomized to weekly SMBP monitoring prompts responded more frequently overall and were more likely to be classed as high engagers compared to participants who received daily prompts. High engagement was associated with a larger decrease in BP. New strategies to encourage engagement are needed for participants with lower access to care.",10.2196/54946,Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0

Buis,Equitable Research PRAXIS: A Framework for Health Informatics Methods,2022.0,Yearbook of Medical Informatics,Article,Ear; Tics; Research; Work; Informatics; conceptual frameworks; health disparities; Health equity; marginalized populations; research methods; Ear; Tics; Research; Work; Informatics,"2022 IMIA and Georg Thieme Verlag KG.Objectives: There is growing attention to health equity in health informatics research. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive framework outlining critical considerations for health informatics research with marginalized groups. Methods: Literature review and experiences from nine equity-focused health informatics conducted in the United States and Canada. Studies focus on disparities related to age, disability or chronic illness, gender/sex, place of residence (rural/urban), race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Results: We found four key equity-related methodological considerations. To assist informaticists in addressing equity, we contribute a novel framework to synthesize these four considerations: PRAXIS (Participation and Representation, Appropriate methods and interventions, conteXtualization and structural competence, Investigation of Systematic differences). Participation and representation refers to the necessity for meaningful participation of marginalized groups in research, to elevate the voices of marginalized people, and to represent marginalized people as they are comfortable (e.g., asset-based versus deficit-based). Appropriate methods and interventions mean targeting methods, instruments, and interventions to reach and engage marginalized people. Contextualization and structural competence mean avoiding individualization of systematic disparities and targeting social conditions that (re-)produce inequities. Investigation of systematic differences highlights that experiences of people marginalized according to specific traits differ from those not so marginalized, and thus encourages studying the specificity of these differences and investigating and preventing intervention-generated inequality. We outline guidance for operationalizing these considerations at four research stages. Conclusions: This framework can assist informaticists in systematically addressing these considerations in their research in four research stages: project initiation; sampling and recruitment; data collection; and data analysis. We encourage others to use these insights from multiple studies to advance health equity in informatics.",10.1055/s-0042-1742542,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0

Racial and ethnic minorities, older adults, individuals with less education, and lower-income households have lower rates of home broadband, smartphone ownership, and patient portal adoption, which may directly affect access to virtual care. Because primary care is a major access point to healthcare, perspectives of primary care providers are critical to inform the implementation of equitable virtual care. Objective: The aim of this mixed methods study was to explore primary care physician experiences and perceptions of barriers and facilitators to equitable virtual care. Design: We used an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, which consists of first collecting and analyzing quantitative survey data, then using those results to inform a qualitative follow-up phase to explain and expand on results. Participants: Primary care physicians in a family medicine department at an academic medical center responded to surveys (n = 38) and participated in interviews (n = 16). Approach: Participants completed a survey concerning frequency and preferences about video visits, pros and cons of video visits, communication aspects, and sufficiency of the technology. A purposeful sample of participants completed semi-structured interviews about their virtual care experiences with a focus on equity for subpopulations. Key Results: The results indicated that physicians have observed equity issues for unique patient populations. The results add to the understanding of nuanced ways in which virtual care can increase and decrease healthcare access for unique populations. Patients with limited English proficiency were particularly affected by inequity in virtual care access. Conclusion: Additional research and interventions are needed to improve portal access for those with limited English proficiency. Improvements should focus on health system interventions that expand access without requiring increased patient burden.",10.1177/1357633X231194382,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

However, many patients are not using BP telemonitoring due to personal, technological, and health system barriers. Individuals are required to have electronic health literacy (e-HL), defined as knowledge and skills to use technology services effectively, such as BP telemonitoring. Objective: The objective was to determine the facilitators and barriers experienced by patients with hypertension in telemonitoring of BP using the e-HL framework (e-HLF). Methods: This study was a prospective mixed-methods study using a convergent design. We recruited a convenience sample of 21 patients with hypertension. The qualitative section was online or phone individual in-depth interviews based on the e-HLF, which has seven domains. The quantitative section was an online survey consisting of demographics, an e-HL questionnaire, and patient–provider communication preferences. A joint display was used in the mixed-methods analysis. Results: Five themes including knowledge, motivation, skills, systems, and behaviors along with 28 subthemes comprising facilitators or barriers of BP telemonitoring were identified. The mixed-methods results showed concordance between the participants’ e-HL status and their experiences in the ability to actively engage with BP monitoring and managing digital services (domain 3) of the e-HLF.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical Informatics Association.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate how healthcare staff intermediaries support Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) patients' access to telehealth, how their approaches reflect cognitive load theory (CLT) and determine which approaches FQHC patients find helpful and whether their perceptions suggest cognitive load (CL) reduction. Materials and Methods: Semistructured interviews with staff (n = 9) and patients (n = 22) at an FQHC in a Midwestern state. First-cycle coding of interview transcripts was performed inductively to identify helping processes and participants' evaluations of them. Next, these inductive codes were mapped onto deductive codes from CLT. Results: Staff intermediaries used 4 approaches to support access to, and usage of, video visits and patient portals for FQHC patients: (1) shielding patients from cognitive overload; (2) drawing from long-term memory; (3) supporting the development of schemas; and (4) reducing the extraneous load of negative emotions. These approaches could contribute to CL reduction and each was viewed as helpful to at least some patients. For patients, there were beneficial impacts on learning, emotions, and perceptions about the self and technology. Intermediation also resulted in successful visits despite challenges. Discussion: Staff intermediaries made telehealth work for FQHC patients, and emotional support was crucial. Without prior training, staff discovered approaches that aligned with CLT and helped patients access technologies. Future healthcare intermediary interventions may benefit from the application of CLT in their design. Staff providing brief explanations about technical problems and solutions might help patients learn about technologies informally over time. Conclusion: CLT can help with developing intermediary approaches for facilitating telehealth access.",10.1093/jamia/ocad257,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

All rights reserved.Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in rapid changes in how patient care was provided, particularly through the expansion of telehealth and audio-only phone-based care. Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate inequities in video and audio-only care during various time points including the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, later stages of the pandemic, and a historical control. We sought to understand the characteristics of care during this time for a variety of different groups of patients that may experience health care inequities. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data from encounters from 34 family medicine and internal medicine primary care clinics in a large, Midwestern health system, using a repeated cross-sectional, observational study design. These data included patient demographic data, as well as encounter, diagnosis, and procedure records. Data were obtained for all in-person and telehealth encounters (including audio-only phone-based care) that occurred during 3 separate time periods: an initial COVID-19 period (T2: March 16, 2020, to May 3, 2020), a later COVID-19 period (T3: May 4, 2020, to September 30, 2020), and a historical control period from the previous year (T1: March 16, 2019, to September 30, 2019). Primary analysis focused on the status of each encounter in terms of whether it was completed as scheduled, it was canceled, or the patient missed the appointment. A secondary analysis was performed to evaluate the likelihood of an encounter being completed based on visit modality (phone, video, in-person). Results: In total, there were 938,040 scheduled encounters during the 3 time periods, with 178,747 unique patients, that were included for analysis. Patients with completed encounters were more likely to be younger than 65 years old (71.8%-74.1%), be female (58.8%-61.8%), be White (75.6%-76.7%), and have no significant comorbidities (63.2%-66.8%) or disabilities (53.2%-61.1%) in all time periods than those who had only canceled or missed encounters. Effects on different subpopulations are discussed herein. Conclusions: Findings from this study demonstrate that primary care utilization across delivery modalities (in person, video, and phone) was not equivalent across all groups before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and different groups were differentially impacted at different points. Understanding how different groups of patients responded to these rapid changes and how health care inequities may have been affected is an important step in better understanding implementation strategies for digital solutions in the future.",10.2196/49804,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0

Methods: We used data from a cross-sectional online survey of a nationally representative sample of 2074 U.S. adults ages 50–80 who were participants in the National Poll on Healthy Aging. We performed a descriptive and multivariable analysis of individuals’ perspectives on past and future telehealth visits, sociodemographics, and health status. Results: Before March 2020, 5.8% of respondents had used telehealth, compared to 32.0% by June 2020. Of telehealth users, 36.1% indicated their most recent telehealth visit used audio-only (i.e., without video) technology. In multivariable analysis, those who never used video technology compared to those who were “very comfortable” (average marginal effect (AME) 49%, 95% CI: 36–63), identified as Hispanic (AME 19% vs White, non-Hispanic, 95% CI: 5–32), or were female (AME 9%, 95% CI: 1–17) were more likely to report audio-only use. Concerns remained about the inability to conduct physical exams (75%) and telehealth quality of care (67%), though most (64%) older adults indicated an interest in future telehealth visits. Discussion: Telehealth use increased substantially among older U.S. adults during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, many reported using audio-only telehealth, an important consideration for policymakers and providers. Addressing older adults’ concerns about and barriers to telehealth visits is needed to ensure telehealth does not exacerbate disparities in their care.",10.1177/1357633X231166031,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0

All rights reserved.Background: Uncontrolled hypertension leads to significant morbidity and mortality. The use of mobile health technology, such as smartphones, for remote blood pressure (BP) monitoring has improved BP control. An increase in BP control is more significant when patients can remotely communicate with their health care providers through technologies and receive feedback. Little is known about the predictors of remote BP monitoring among hypertensive populations. Objective: The objective of this study is to quantify the predictors of smartphone and tablet use in achieving health goals and communicating with health care providers via SMS text messaging among hypertensive patients in the United States. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional, secondary analysis of the 2017 and 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey 5, cycles 1 and 2 data. A total of 3045 respondents answered “Yes” to the question “Has a doctor or other healthcare provider ever told you that you had high blood pressure or hypertension?”, which defined the subpopulation used in this study. We applied the Health Information National Trends Survey full sample weight to calculate the population estimates and 50 replicate weights to calculate the SEs of the estimates. We used design-adjusted descriptive statistics to describe the characteristics of respondents who are hypertensive based on relevant survey items. Design-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to estimate predictors of achieving health goals with the help of smartphone or tablet and sending or receiving an SMS text message to or from a health care provider in the last 12 months. Results: An estimated 36.9%, SE 0.9% (183,285,150/497,278,883) of the weighted adult population in the United States had hypertension. The mean age of the hypertensive population was 58.3 (SE 0.48) years. Electronic communication with the doctor or doctor’s office through email or internet (odds ratio 2.93, 95% CI 1.85-4.63; P<.001) and having a wellness app (odds ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.16-2.86; P=.02) were significant predictors of using SMS text message communication with a health care professional, adjusting for other demographic and technology-related variables. The odds of achieving health-related goals with the help of a tablet or smartphone declined significantly with older age (P<.001) and ownership of basic cellphones (P=.04). However, they increased significantly with being a woman (P=.045) or with being married (P=.03), having a wellness app (P<.001), using devices other than smartphones or tablets to monitor health (P=.008), making health treatment decisions (P=.048), and discussing with a provider (P=.02) with the help of a tablet or smartphone. Conclusions: Intervention measures accounting for age, gender, marital status, and the patient’s technology-related health behaviors are required to increase smartphone and tablet use in self-care and SMS text message communication with health care providers.",10.2196/33188,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Mobile health (mHealth) strategies initiated in safety-net Emergency Departments may be one approach to address the US hypertension epidemic, but the optimal mHealth components or dose are unknown. Methods: Reach Out is an mHealth, health theory-based, 2×2×2 factorial trial among hypertensive patients evaluated in a safety-net Emergency Department in Flint, Michigan. Reach Out consisted of 3 mHealth components, each with 2 doses: (1) healthy behavior text messaging (yes versus no), (2) prompted self-measured blood pressure (BP) monitoring and feedback (weekly versus daily), and (3) facilitated primary care provider appointment scheduling and transportation (yes versus no). The primary outcome was a change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. In a complete case analysis, we fit a linear regression model and accounted for age, sex, race, and prior BP medications to explore the association between systolic BP and each mHealth component. Results: Among 488 randomized participants, 211 (43%) completed follow-up. Mean age was 45.5 years, 61% were women, 54% were Black people, 22% did not have a primary care doctor, 21% lacked transportation, and 51% were not taking antihypertensive medications. Overall, systolic BP declined after 6 months (-9.2 mm Hg [95% CI, -12.2 to -6.3]) and 12 months (-6.6 mm Hg, -9.3 to -3.8), without a difference across the 8 treatment arms. The higher dose of mHealth components were not associated with a greater change in systolic BP; healthy behavior text messages (point estimate, mmHG=-0.5 [95% CI, -6.0 to 5]; P=0.86), daily self-measured BP monitoring (point estimate, mmHG=1.9 [95% CI, -3.7 to 7.5]; P=0.50), and facilitated primary care provider scheduling and transportation (point estimate, mmHG=0 [95% CI, -5.5 to 5.6]; P=0.99). Conclusions: Among participants with elevated BP recruited from an urban safety-net Emergency Department, BP declined over the 12-month intervention period. There was no difference in change in systolic BP among the 3 mHealth components. Reach Out demonstrated the feasibility of reaching medically underserved people with high BP cared for at a safety-net Emergency Departments, yet the efficacy of the Reach Out mHealth intervention components requires further study.

Human intermediaries can be a strategy for addressing health care access disparities by acting as technology helpers to reduce the cognitive load demands required to learn and use patient-facing telehealth technologies. Objective: We conducted a cognitive load theory–informed pilot intervention involving warm accompaniment telehealth helping sessions with patients at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). We demonstrate how to design and report recruitment methods, reach, delivery process, and the preliminary impact of a novel equity-focused intervention. Methods: Early into the COVID-19 pandemic a telehealth helping session was offered to patients at FQHC via phone. Graduate students led the sessions on conducting a telehealth video test run or helping with patient portal log-in. They systematically recorded their recruitment efforts, intervention observations, and daily reflection notes. Following the intervention, we asked the intervention participants to participate in an interview and all patients who had telehealth visits during and 4 weeks before and after the intervention period to complete a survey. Electronic health records were reviewed to assess telehealth visit format changes. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the recruitment records, electronic health record data, and surveys were performed. Through integrative analysis, we developed process-related themes and recommendations for future equity-focused telehealth interventions. Results: Of the 239 eligible patients, 34 (14.2%) completed the intervention and 3 (1.2%) completed subsequent interviews. The intervention participants who completed the survey (n=15) had lower education and less technological experience than the nonintervention survey participants (n=113). We identified 3 helping strategies for cognitive load reduction: providing step-by-step guidance for configuring and learning, building rapport to create confidence while problem-solving, and being on the same page to counter informational distractions. Intervention participants reported increased understanding but found that learning the video visit software was more difficult than nonintervention participants. A comparison of visit experiences did not find differences in difficulty (cognitive load measure) using telehealth-related technologies, changes to visit modality, or reported technical problems during the visit. However, the intervention participants were significantly less satisfied with the video visits. Conclusions: Although a limited number of people participated in the intervention, it may have reached individuals more likely to need technology assistance. We postulate that significant differences between intervention and nonintervention participants were rooted in baseline differences between the groups’ education level, technology experience, and technology use frequency; however, small sample sizes limit conclusions. The barriers encountered during the intervention suggest that patients at FQHC may require both improved access to web-based technologies and human intermediary support to make telehealth video visits feasible. Future large, randomized, equity-focused studies should investigate blended strategies to facilitate video visit access.",10.2196/42586,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

The authors of this article represented a group focused on the research needs, constructs, and strategies in the post-COVID era. While telemedicine and telehealth grew exponentially during the pandemic, the challenges that have been with us for decades, while ameliorated to some extent, remain. To showcase the State of Michigan as a model, the authors reviewed challenges and opportunities related to telehealth and telemedicine usage and categorized them into seven areas of highest priority. Based on a review of the literature and consultation in the fields of telehealth, telemedicine, and digital access, we identified seven key categories where research would be most effective going forward. These categories include research into the impact of telehealth on clinical services, telehealth's use in administrative activities, education and training for health care providers and patients, telehealth policy implications at state and federal levels, the impact of future technology and innovation on telehealth services, patient characteristics and their experiences, and the ethical aspects of telehealth in the future. We have formulated this overview of our findings to act as a roadmap for future telehealth research. We recommend that ongoing studies should explore each of the seven categories identified above. The search for solutions to overcome the challenges within these topics must not be constrained to research that has been conducted recently; many of these challenges have faced telehealth researchers for decades, and numerous solutions have been proposed over the years. Some of these proposals should be explored once again in light of technological and societal advances. The findings from these studies should be shared in ways and through venues that can make them accessible outside the spheres of academic research, but also by practitioners, policymakers, and patients. Third, research into telehealth in all its incarnations must be prioritized, and leadership is needed to ensure these areas of study are continued to be spotlighted after the noise of the COVID-19 pandemic grows quiet.",10.1089/tmj.2024.0520,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

Hypertension-related health inequities are abundant in Black communities as Black individuals are more likely to use the emergency department (ED) for chronic disease-related ambulatory care, which is strongly linked to lower blood pressure (BP) control, diminished awareness of hypertension, and adverse cardiovascular events. To reduce hypertension-related health disparities, we developed MI-BP, a culturally tailored multibehavior mobile health intervention that targeted behaviors of BP self-monitoring, physical activity, sodium intake, and medication adherence in Black individuals with uncontrolled hypertension recruited from ED and community-based settings. Objective: We sought to determine the effect of MI-BP on BP as well as secondary outcomes of physical activity, sodium intake, medication adherence, and BP control compared to enhanced usual care control at 1-year follow-up. Methods: We conducted a 1-year, 2-group randomized controlled trial of the MI-BP intervention compared to an enhanced usual care control group where participants aged 25 to 70 years received a BP cuff and hypertension-related educational materials. Participants were recruited from EDs and other community-based settings in Detroit, Michigan, where they were screened for initial eligibility and enrolled. Baseline data collection and randomization occurred approximately 2 and 4 weeks after enrollment to ensure that participants had uncontrolled hypertension and were willing to take part. Data collection visits occurred at 13, 26, 39, and 52 weeks. Outcomes of interest included BP (primary outcome) and physical activity, sodium intake, medication adherence, and BP control (secondary outcomes). Results: We obtained consent from and enrolled 869 participants in this study yet ultimately randomized 162 (18.6%) participants. At 1 year, compared to the baseline, both groups showed significant decreases in systolic BP (MI-BP group: 22.5 mm Hg decrease in average systolic BP and P<.001; control group: 24.1 mm Hg decrease and P<.001) adjusted for age and sex, with no significant differences between the groups (time-by-arm interaction: P = .99). Similar patterns where improvements were noted in both groups yet no differences were found between the groups were observed for diastolic BP, physical activity, sodium intake, medication adherence, and BP control. Large dropout rates were observed in both groups (approximately 60%). Conclusions: Overall, participants randomized to both the enhanced usual care control and MI-BP conditions experienced significant improvements in BP and other outcomes; however, differences between groups were not detected, speaking to the general benefit of proactive outreach and engagement focused on cardiometabolic risk reduction in urban-dwelling, low-socioeconomic-status Black populations. High dropout rates were found and are likely to be expected when working with similar populations. Future work is needed to better understand engagement with mobile health interventions, particularly in this population.",10.2196/57863,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0
Lorraine R. Buis,The Perceived Benefits of Digital Interventions for Behavioral Health: Qualitative Interview Study,2022.0,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Article,Interview; Interview,"2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.Background: Digital interventions have gained momentum in terms of behavioral health. However, owing to lacking standard approaches or tools for creating digital behavioral interventions, clinical researchers follow widely varying conceptions of how best to go about digital intervention development. Researchers also face significant cost-, time-, and expertise-related challenges in digital intervention development. Improving the availability of tools and guidance for researchers will require a thorough understanding of the motivations and needs of researchers seeking to create digital interventions. Objective: This study aims to understand the perceptions of behavioral researchers toward digital interventions, and inform the use of these interventions, by documenting the reasons why researchers are increasingly focusing their efforts on digital interventions and their perspectives on the perceived benefits that digital approaches can provide for researchers and intervention recipients. Methods: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 18 researchers who had experience designing digital behavioral interventions or running studies with them. A convenience sample of interviewees was recruited from among users of the Computerized Intervention Authoring System platform, a web-based tool that facilitates the process of creating and deploying digital interventions in behavioral research. Interviews were conducted over teleconference between February and April 2020. Recordings from the interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed by multiple coders. Results: Interviews were completed with 18 individuals and lasted between 24 and 65 (mean 46.9, SD 11.3) minutes. Interviewees were predominantly female (17/18, 94%) and represented different job roles, ranging from researcher to project or study staff. Four major themes came out of the interviews concerning the benefits of digital interventions for behavioral health: convenience and flexibility for interventionists and recipients, support for implementing evidence-based interventions with fidelity, scaling and improving access to interventions, and getting a foot in the door despite stigma and disenfranchisement. Conclusions: Interviewees described a number of important potential benefits of digital interventions, particularly with respect to scientific rigor, scalability, and overcoming barriers to reaching more people. There are complex considerations with regard to translating behavior change strategies into digital forms of delivery, and interventionists make individual, sometimes unexpected, choices with minimal evidence of their relative effectiveness. Future research should investigate how behavioral researchers can be supported in making these choices toward usability, ease of access, and approachability of digital interventions. Our study underscores the need for authoring platforms that can facilitate the process of creating and deploying digital interventions to reach their full potential for interventionists and recipients alike.",10.2196/34300,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,2252596.0

Buis,"Understanding the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a clinical pharmacist-led mobile approach (BPTrack) to hypertension management: Mixed methods pilot study",2020.0,Journal of Medical Internet Research,Article,Arm; Hypertension; Blood pressure; cell phone; Hypertension; Medication adherence; Mobile phone; Pharmacists; Telemedicine,"2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.Background: Hypertension is a prevalent and costly burden in the United States. Clinical pharmacists within care teams provide effective management of hypertension, as does home blood pressure monitoring; however, concerns about data quality and latency are widespread. One approach to close the gap between clinical pharmacist intervention and home blood pressure monitoring is the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology. Objective: We sought to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of BPTrack, a clinical pharmacist-led intervention that incorporates patient- A nd clinician-facing apps to make electronically collected, patient-generated data available to providers in real time for hypertension management. The patient app also included customizable daily medication reminders and educational messages. Additionally, this study sought to understand barriers to adoption and areas for improvement identified by key stakeholders, so more widespread use of such interventions may be achieved. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods pilot study of BPTrack, to improve blood pressure control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension through a 12-week pre-post intervention. All patients were recruited from a primary care setting where they worked with a clinical pharmacist for hypertension management. Participants completed a baseline visit, then spent 12 weeks utilizing BPTrack before returning to the clinic for follow-up. Collected data from patient participants included surveys pre- A nd postintervention, clinical measures (for establishing effectiveness, with the primary outcome being a change in blood pressure and the secondary outcome being a change in medication adherence), utilization of the BPTrack app, interviews at follow-up, and chart review. We also conducted interviews with key stakeholders. Results: A total of 15 patient participants were included (13 remained through follow-up for an 86.7% retention rate) in a single group, pre-post assessment pilot study. Data supported the hypothesis that BPTrack was feasible and acceptable for use by patient and provider participants and was effective at reducing patient blood pressure. At the 12-week follow-up, patients exhibited significant reductions in both systolic blood pressure (baseline mean 137.3 mm Hg, SD 11.1 mm Hg; follow-up mean 131.0 mm Hg, SD 9.9 mm Hg; P=.02) and diastolic blood pressure (baseline mean 89.4 mm Hg, SD 7.7 mm Hg; follow-up mean 82.5 mm Hg, SD 8.2 mm Hg; P<.001). On average, patients uploaded at least one blood pressure measurement on 75% (SD 25%) of study days. No improvements in medication adherence were noted. Interview data revealed areas of improvement and refinement for the patient experience. Furthermore, stakeholders require integration into the electronic health record and a modified clinical workflow for BPTrack to be truly useful; however, both patients and stakeholders perceived benefits of BPTrack when used within the context of a clinical relationship. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that a pharmacist-led mHealth intervention promoting home blood pressure monitoring and clinical pharmacist management of hypertension can be effective at reducing blood pressure in primary care patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Our data also support the feasibility and acceptability of these types of interventions for patients and providers.",10.2196/19882,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

From family physicians’ perspectives, this shift to virtual care has the potential to affect workflow, job satisfaction, and patient communication. As clinics reopened and care delivery models shifted to a combination of in-person and virtual care, the need to understand physician experiences with virtual care arose in order to improve both patient and provider experiences. This study investigated Michigan Medicine family medicine physicians’ perceptions of virtual care through qualitative interviews to better understand how to improve the quality and effectiveness of virtual care for both patients and physicians. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive design to examine physician perspectives through semistructured interviews. We coded and analyzed transcripts using thematic analysis, facilitated by MAXQDA (VERBI) software. Results: The results of the analysis identified four major themes: (a) chief concerns that are appropriate for virtual evaluation, (b) physician perceptions of patient benefits, (c) focused but contextually enriched patient-physician communication, and (d) structural support needed for high-quality virtual care.

Human intermediaries can be a strategy for addressing health care access disparities by acting as technology helpers to reduce the cognitive load demands required to learn and use patient-facing telehealth technologies. Objective: We conducted a cognitive load theory–informed pilot intervention involving warm accompaniment telehealth helping sessions with patients at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). We demonstrate how to design and report recruitment methods, reach, delivery process, and the preliminary impact of a novel equity-focused intervention. Methods: Early into the COVID-19 pandemic a telehealth helping session was offered to patients at FQHC via phone. Graduate students led the sessions on conducting a telehealth video test run or helping with patient portal log-in. They systematically recorded their recruitment efforts, intervention observations, and daily reflection notes. Following the intervention, we asked the intervention participants to participate in an interview and all patients who had telehealth visits during and 4 weeks before and after the intervention period to complete a survey. Electronic health records were reviewed to assess telehealth visit format changes. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the recruitment records, electronic health record data, and surveys were performed. Through integrative analysis, we developed process-related themes and recommendations for future equity-focused telehealth interventions. Results: Of the 239 eligible patients, 34 (14.2%) completed the intervention and 3 (1.2%) completed subsequent interviews. The intervention participants who completed the survey (n=15) had lower education and less technological experience than the nonintervention survey participants (n=113). We identified 3 helping strategies for cognitive load reduction: providing step-by-step guidance for configuring and learning, building rapport to create confidence while problem-solving, and being on the same page to counter informational distractions. Intervention participants reported increased understanding but found that learning the video visit software was more difficult than nonintervention participants. A comparison of visit experiences did not find differences in difficulty (cognitive load measure) using telehealth-related technologies, changes to visit modality, or reported technical problems during the visit. However, the intervention participants were significantly less satisfied with the video visits. Conclusions: Although a limited number of people participated in the intervention, it may have reached individuals more likely to need technology assistance. We postulate that significant differences between intervention and nonintervention participants were rooted in baseline differences between the groups’ education level, technology experience, and technology use frequency; however, small sample sizes limit conclusions. The barriers encountered during the intervention suggest that patients at FQHC may require both improved access to web-based technologies and human intermediary support to make telehealth video visits feasible. Future large, randomized, equity-focused studies should investigate blended strategies to facilitate video visit access.",10.2196/42586,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5855-9972,57204346657.0,

Evaluating a Competency-Based Time-Variable Training Pilot",2023.0,Academic Medicine,Article,"learner motivation, residents motivation, training impact, medicine education, training pilot, timeless training, evaluating competency, resident motivation, purpose competency","Copyright © 2023 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.Purpose: As competency-based medical education has become the predominant graduate medical education training model, interest in time-variable training has grown. Despite multiple competency-based time-variable training (CBTVT) pilots ongoing in the United States, little is known about how this training approach impacts learners. The authors aim to explore how their CBTVT pilot program impacted resident motivation for learning, assessment, and feedback. Method: The authors performed a qualitative educational case study on the Transitioning in Internal Medicine Education Leveraging Entrustment Scores Synthesis (TIMELESS) program at the University of Cincinnati from October 2020 through March 2022. Semistructured interviews were conducted with TIMELESS residents (n = 9) approximately every 6 months to capture experiences over time. The authors used inductive thematic analysis to develop themes and compared their findings with existing theories of learner motivation. Results: The authors developed 2 themes: TIMELESS had variable effects on residents' motivation for learning and TIMELESS increased resident engagement with and awareness of the program of assessment. Participants reported increased motivation to learn and seek assessment, though some felt a tension between performance (e.g., advancement through the residency program) and growth (e.g., improvement as a physician). Participants became more aware of the quality of assessments they received, in part due to TIMELESS increasing the perceived stakes of assessment, and reported being more deliberate when assessing other residents. Conclusions: Resident motivation for learning, assessment, and feedback was impacted in ways that the authors contextualize using current theories of learner motivation (i.e., goal orientation theory and attribution theory). Future research should investigate how interventions, such as coaching, guided learner reflection, or various CBTVT implementation strategies, can help keep learners oriented toward mastery learning rather than toward performance.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000005147,University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,0000-0002-9125-7180,57210798338.0,

To address inequity, health professions educators must critically examine their implicit understandings of truth and knowledge (i.e., their epistemologies) with regard to educational assessment before jumping to solutions. The authors use the analogy of a ship (program of assessment) sailing on different seas (epistemologies) to describe their journey in seeking to improve equity in assessment. Should the education community repair the ship of assessment while sailing or should the ship be scrapped and built anew? The authors share a case study of a well-developed internal medicine residency program of assessment and describe efforts to evaluate and enable equity using various epistemological lenses. They first used a postpositivist lens to evaluate if the systems and strategies aligned with best practices, but found they did not capture important nuances of what equitable assessment entails. Next, they used a constructivist approach to improve stakeholder engagement, but found they still failed to question the inequitable assumptions inherent to their systems and strategies. Finally, they describe a shift to critical epistemologies, seeking to understand who experiences inequity and harm to dismantle inequitable systems and create better ones. The authors describe how each unique sea promoted different adaptations to their ship, and challenge programs to sail through new epistemological waters as a starting point for making their own ships more equitable.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000005249,University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,0000-0002-9125-7180,57210798338.0,

Research has demonstrated that biases negatively affect patient outcomes and stifle diversity across the physician workforce, further compounding health disparities by worsening patient-physician concordance. Taken as one, the application, interview, recruitment, and selection processes employed by residency programs has been one of the critical junctures where bias has exacerbated inequities among future physicians.

In this article, the authors describe why CCC group decision-making processes should be supported by theory and review 3 theories they used in designing their group processes: social decision scheme theory, functional theory, and wisdom of crowds. They describe how these theories were applied in a competency-based, time-variable training pilot - Transitioning in Internal Medicine Education Leveraging Entrustment Scores Synthesis (TIMELESS) at the University of Cincinnati internal medicine residency program in 2020-2022 - to increase the defensibility of their CCC group decision-making.

Progress has been made toward developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n 490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1-and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12 min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability. IMPORTANCE Diagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely overoptimistic. Moreover, there is a trend toward using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step toward developing more-reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.",10.1128/mBio.00434-20,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Typically, the translation is static, using a fixed model derived from animal experiments for the duration of the trial. Bayesian designs, capable of incorporating information external to the experiment, provide a dynamic translational strategy. This article demonstrates an example of such a dynamic Bayesian strategy in a clinical trial. Methods: This study explored the effect of a personalized dose of fish oil for reducing prostaglandin E2, an inflammatory marker linked to colorectal cancer. A Bayesian design was implemented for the dose-finding algorithm that adaptively updated a dose–response model derived from a previously completed animal study during the clinical trial. In the initial stages of the trial, the dose–response model parameters were estimated from the rodent data. The model was updated following a Bayesian algorithm after data on every 10‒15 subjects were obtained until the model stabilized. Subjects were enrolled in the study between 2013 and 2015, and the data analysis was carried out in 2016. Results: The 3 dosing models were used for groups of 16, 15, and 15 subjects. The mean target dose significantly decreased from 6.63 g/day (Model 1) to 4.06 g/day (Model 3) (p=0.001). Compared with the static strategy of dosing with a single model, the dynamic modeling reduced the dose significantly by about 1.38 g/day on average. Conclusions: A Bayesian design was effective in adaptively revising the dosing algorithm, resulting in a lower pill burden.

This study investigates this association and examines the differential impacts among different age and race/ethnicity subgroups. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with breast cancer aged 40–74 years diagnosed between 2005 and 2016. Using a difference-in-differences multinomial logistic model, the odds of being diagnosed at different stages of cancer relative to the localized stage depending on legislation and individual characteristics were examined. Analyses were conducted in 2020–2021. Results: The study included 689,641 cases. Overall, the impact of notification legislation was not significant, whereas insurance coverage legislation was associated with 6% lower odds (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.91, 0.96) of being diagnosed at the regional stage. The association between insurance coverage legislation and stage of diagnosis was even stronger among women aged 40–49 years, with 11% lower odds (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.82, 0.96) of being diagnosed at the regional stage and 12% lower odds (OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.81, 0.96) of being diagnosed at the distant stage. Hispanic women benefited from notification laws, with 11% lower odds (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.82, 0.97) of being diagnosed at distant stage. Neither notification nor supplemental screening insurance coverage legislation showed a substantial impact on Black women. Conclusions: The findings imply that improving insurance coverage is more important than being notified overall. Raising awareness is important among Hispanic women; improving communication about dense breasts and access to screening might be more important than legislation among Black women.",10.1016/j.amepre.2021.05.020,Penn State Cancer Institute,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

The trial aimed to reduce colonic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a pro-inflammatory product of arachidonic acid (AA) oxidation. The personalized doses ranged 2–10 grams/day (54% eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, 24% other ω-3 fatty acids). In colon, increases in ω-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) and EPA:AA ratios each were correlated with decreases in PGE2. Changes in either colonic EPA:AA ratios or ω-3 HUFA were significantly correlated with changes in the same fatty acid measures in red blood cells or serum. The only blood-based measure significantly correlated with changes in colonic PGE2 was change in red blood cell ω-3 HUFA (ρ = −0.39), and the increase in red blood cell ω-3 HUFA was significantly greater in participants who had at least a median reduction in colonic PGE2 vs. those who did not. In summary, fatty acid changes in blood did reflect fatty acid changes in the colon, but additional factors will be needed for optimizing dosing models that seek to predict the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 fatty acids on the colon.",10.1080/01635581.2021.1903950,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,33118124.0
Mack Ruffin,Chaperone use by family physicians during the collection of a Pap smear,2003.0,Ann Fam Med,Article,Ear; Family,"BACKGROUND: We wanted to determine whether variations exist in use of a chaperone during the performance of a pelvic examination by family physicians. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 5,000 randomly selected active members of the American Academy of Family Physicians. RESULTS: There were 3,551 survey responses (71% response rate) and 2,748 useable questionnaires. Most respondents (75.4%) reported routinely using a chaperone in the room during the collection of a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. Significantly (P < .00001) more male physicians (84.1%) than female physicians (31.4%) reported using a chaperone. Physicians reporting routine use of a chaperone were significantly younger (P = .01) and did fewer Pap smears per month (P < .00001).

Mack Ruffin,Clinical utility of HPV testing in cervical cancer screening,2013.0,"Handbook on Human Papillomavirus: Prevalence, Detection and Management",Book Chapter,Tin,"Cervical cancer remains the second most common cause of cancer death among women around the world. It has been recognized as a rare outcome of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted infection. Persistent infection with high-risk oncogenic HPV types is a known cause of cervical cancer. The benefits of cytological screening for cervical cancer are well known. However, the necessary resources, infrastructure and technological expertise, together with the need for repeated screening at regular intervals, make cytological screening resource intense. HPV DNA testing is a viable alternative to cytological screening. With optimal testing systems, HPV DNA can be identified in nearly all specimens of invasive cervical cancer and in the vast majority (>95%) of the immediate cervical cancer precursors, namely high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). HPV DNA testing has been shown to decrease cervical cancer mortality. In this chapter, the clinical utility of HPV DNA testing for cervical cancer will be reviewed with a focus on primary screening, combination with cytology (co-testing), triage for abnormal cytology, and post-treatment surveillance. The review focuses on cost and patient outcomes in a wide variety of resource settings, contrasting HPV testing to other screening strategies. Technology exists today, which could eradicate death from cervical cancer. It is time to act. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

As part of a larger randomized controlled trial conducted between 2011 and 2016 in the setting of community and academic family medicine or internal medicine practices in Michigan, USA, patients completed a pre-encounter survey, completed their regularly scheduled visit with their primary care clinician (which was audio-recorded), completed a post-encounter survey, and allowed 6-month follow-up chart audit. We trained 10 coders to rate 216 of the audio-recorded conversations between 216 patients and their primary care physicians for 6 specific features of communication quality (using 7-point scales), including the extent to which participants enacted attention to medical content, engagement, emotional expression, relationships, face, and accommodation. At least 3 coders rated each conversation, and intraclass correlations (i.e., reliability assessment) were in the good to excellent range. We found that patient and clinician attention to face (an identity goal) was a significant predictor of colorectal cancer screening at 6 months follow up. Measuring communication in terms of attention to multiple goals reveals unexpected findings about the aspects of communication that impact colorectal cancer screening behavior. The focus of many interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening rates is on the content (i.e., task goals) of clinicians' communication (such as presenting the different options for screening), yet the content of communication was not a significant predictor of screening in the present study. Rather, clinicians' and patients’ attention to identity goals predicted screening behavior, which suggests that interventions may not need to be overly complex and that simply improving the quality of attention to identity goals in clinician communication might be one of the most straightforward yet impactful ways to improve colorectal cancer screening uptake among patients.",10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117199,University of Kentucky,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Risk factors include family history, smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity, diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol use, and possible dietary factors. Because more than two-thirds of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas, abdominal pain, jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, and acholic stools may be presenting symptoms. In symptomatic patients, the serum tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to predict prognosis and recurrence after resection. Pancreas protocol computed tomography is considered standard for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Although surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, less than 20% of surgical candidates survive five years. The decision on resectability requires multidisciplinary consultation. Pancreatic resections should be performed at institutions that complete at least 15 of the surgeries annually. Postoperatively, use of gemcitabine or fluorouracil/leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival by several months. However, more than 80% of patients present with disease that is not surgically resectable. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemoradiotherapy with gemcitabine or irinotecan provides clinical benefit and modest survival improvement. Palliation should address pain control, biliary and gastric outlet obstruction, malnutrition, thromboembolic disease, and depression. © 2014 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,Sidney Kimmel Medical College,0009-0002-1116-955X,55939874100.0,
Mack Ruffin,Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of County-Level Metropolitan Status and Racial Residential Segregation,2022.0,Journal of Community Health,Article,Role; Cancer screening; Cervical cancer; Colorectal cancer; Health behavior; Metropolitan status; Racial residential segregation,"2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Mortality from cervical and colorectal cancers can be reduced through routine screening, which can often be accessed through primary care. However, uptake of screening in the US remains suboptimal, with disparities observed across geographic characteristics, such as metropolitan status or level of racial residential segregation. Little is known about the interaction of metropolitan status and segregation in their relationship with cancer screening. We conducted a quantitative survey of 474 women aged 45–65 in central Pennsylvania. The survey collected county-level characteristics and participant-level demographics, beliefs, cancer screening barriers, and cervical and colorectal cancer screening. We used bivariate and multivariable logistic regression to analyze relationships between metropolitan status and segregation with screening. For cervical cancer screening, 82.8% of participants were up-to-date, which did not differ by county type in the final analysis. Higher healthcare trust, higher cancer fatalism, and reporting cost as a barrier were associated with cervical cancer screening. For colorectal cancer screening, 55.4% of participants were up-to-date, which differed by county type. In metropolitan counties, segregation was not associated with colorectal cancer screening, but in non-metropolitan counties, segregation was associated with greater colorectal cancer screening. The relationship between metropolitan status and being up-to-date with colorectal, but not cervical, cancer screening varied by segregation. Other important beliefs and barriers to screening varied by county type. This research can guide future cancer screening interventions in primary care settings in underserved communities.",10.1007/s10900-021-01035-7,Penn State College of Medicine,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Recent research has demonstrated the involvement of the gut microbiota in CRC development and progression. Microbial biomarkers of disease have focused primarily on the bacterial component of the microbiome; however, the viral portion of the microbiome, consisting of both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses, together known as the virome, has been lesser studied. Here we review the recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and bioinformatics, which have enabled scientists to better understand how viruses might influence the development of colorectal cancer. We discuss the contemporary findings revealing modulations in the virome and their correlation with CRC development and progression. While a variety of challenges still face viral HTS detection in clinical specimens, we consider herein numerous next steps for future basic and clinical research. Clinicians need to move away from a single infectious agent model for disease etiology by grasping new, more encompassing etiological paradigms, in which communities of various microbial components interact with each other and the host. The reporting and indexing of patient health information, socioeconomic data, and other relevant metadata will enable identification of predictive variables and covariates of viral presence and CRC development. Altogether, the virome has a more profound role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression than once thought, and viruses, specific for either human cells or bacteria, are clinically relevant in understanding CRC pathology, patient prognosis, and treatment development.",10.1007/s10620-020-06126-4,,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Understanding older adults’ attitudes and perceptions, especially racial/ethnic minority and underserved adults, of cancer screening can help health care providers determine how best to communicate with older adults about cancer screening and screening cessation. The objective of this study was to determine how older adults primarily from minority/underserved backgrounds perceive cancer screening and overscreening. Methods: Four focus groups (n = 39) were conducted with adults (>=65 years of age) in 3 community settings in south-central Pennsylvania. Two focus groups were conducted in Spanish and translated to English upon transcription. Focus group data was managed and analyzed using QSR NVivo 12. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data where themes emerged following the coding process. Results: The focus group participants had an average age of 74 years and were primarily female (74%) and Hispanic (69%), with 69% reporting having less than a high school degree. Four key themes were identified from the focus groups: (1) importance of tailored and targeted education/information; (2) impact of physician/patient communication; (3) impact of barriers and facilitators to screening on cancer screening cessation; and (4) awareness of importance of screening. Participants were more likely to be agreeable to screening cessation if they received specific information regarding their health status and previous medical history from their physician as to why screening should be stopped and told by their physician that the screening decision is up to them. Conclusions: Older adults prefer individualized information from their physician in order to justify screening cessation but are against incorporating life expectancy into the discussion. Future research should focus on developing interventions to test the effectiveness of culturally tailored screening cessation messages for older adults.",10.1177/2150132720959234,Penn State College of Medicine,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

This study compares the test characteristics of self-sampled high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) tests with clinician-collected hrHPV tests in average-risk (i.e., undergoing routine screening) and high-risk patients (i.e., receiving follow-up after abnormal screening results). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a relatively small cohort of average-risk (n = 35) and high-risk (n = 12) participants completed both clinician-collected and self-sampled hrHPV testing, along with a brief phone survey. We assessed hrHPV positivity, concordance, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity across both methods (for types 16, 18, or other hrHPV). We also explored the relationship between test concordance and sociodemographic/behavioral factors. Results: Among average-risk participants, hrHPV positivity was 6% for both test methods (i.e., hrHPV-positive cases: n = 2), resulting in reported concordance, PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of 100%. Among high-risk participants, hrHPV positivity was 100% for clinician-collected tests but only 67% for self-sampled tests, showing varied concordance and sensitivity. Concordance was not associated with sociodemographic or behavioral factors. Conclusions: Self-sampled hrHPV testing demonstrated high accuracy for average-risk patients in this exploratory study. However, its performance was less consistent in high-risk patients who had already received an abnormal screening result, which could be attributed to spontaneous viral clearance over time. The limited number of participants, particularly HPV-positive cases, suggests caution in interpreting these results. Further research with larger cohorts is necessary to validate these findings and to explore the integration of self-sampled hrHPV testing into routine clinical care, particularly for patients with a history of cervical abnormalities.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Burnout is prevalent among clinicians and entails negative personal, professional, and organizational consequences. Assessments of burnout are typically anonymous to facilitate psychological safety. This limits the capacity of leadership to help struggling providers and reduces the level of demographic detail. Nonanonymous, confidential assessments may facilitate outreach to individuals or targeted interventions for at-risk populations. METHODS: We administered the Maslach Burnout Inventory to physician faculty and advanced practice providers in an academic department of family medicine. We identified a wellness officer within the department who served as an honest broker to keep nonanonymous survey responses confidential. Respondents had the option of taking the survey anonymously or confidentially. Anonymous respondents were allowed to withhold demographic information to ensure anonymity. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 109 providers responded (61% response rate), with 46 (69%) doing so confidentially. Burnout rates were similar between groups: 48% among confidential respondents, and 43% among anonymous respondents (P=.71). Subscales of the MBI also showed no significant differences. Because a large proportion of anonymous respondents withheld demographic data, no demographic trends could be identified among them. Younger confidential respondents were more likely to exhibit depersonalization (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most participants chose to respond confidentially. There was no significant difference in the level of burnout between confidential and anonymous respondents. Our findings refute the conventional wisdom that clinicians require anonymity to respond to burnout surveys. This finding has the potential to open a new line of inquiry regarding burnout, its drivers and potential solutions.",10.22454/FamMed.2020.471855,Pennsylvania State University,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: National guidelines balance risks and benefits of population-level cancer screening among adults with average risk. Older adults are not recommended to receive routine screening, but many continue to be screened (ie, are overscreened). Objective: To assess the prevalence of overscreening for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers among older adults as well as differences in overscreening by metropolitan status. Design, Setting, and Participants: The cross-sectional study examined responses to a telephone survey of 176348 community-dwelling adults. Participants were included if they met age and sex criteria, and they were excluded from each cancer-specific subsample if they had a history of that cancer. Data came from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, administered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposures: Metropolitan status, according to whether participants lived in a metropolitan statistical area. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overscreening was assessed using US Preventive Services Task Force definitions, ie, whether participants self-reported having a screening after the recommended upper age limit for colorectal (75 years), cervical (65 years), or breast (74 years) cancer. Results: Of 176348 participants (155411 [88.1%] women; mean [SE] age, 75.0 [0.04] years; 150871 [85.6%] non-Hispanic white; 60456 [34.3%] with nonmetropolitan residence) the cancer-specific subsamples contained 20937 [11.9%] men and 34244 [19.4%] women for colorectal cancer, 82811 [47.0%] women for cervical cancer, and 38356 [21.8%] women for breast cancer. Overall, 9461 men (59.3%; 95% CI, 57.6%-61.1%) were overscreened for colorectal cancer; 14463 women (56.2%; 95% CI, 54.7%-57.6%), for colorectal cancer; 31988 women (45.8%; 95% CI, 44.9%-46.7%), for cervical cancer; and 26198 women (74.1%; 95% CI, 73.0%-75.3%), for breast cancer. Overscreening was more common in metropolitan than nonmetropolitan areas for colorectal cancer among women (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.39), cervical cancer (aOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.29), and breast cancer (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57). Overscreening for cervical and breast cancers was also associated with having a usual source of care compared with not (eg, cervical cancer: aOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.56-2.25; breast cancer: aOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.58-2.76), good, very good, or excellent self-reported health compared with fair or poor self-reported health (eg, cervical cancer: aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.32; breast cancer: aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.28-1.69), an educational attainment greater than a high school diploma compared with a high school diploma or less (eg, cervical cancer: aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23; breast cancer: aOR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.16-1.46), and being married or living as married compared with other marital status (eg, cervical cancer: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.26-1.46; breast cancer: OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.34-1.77). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, overscreening for cancer among older adults was high, particularly for women living in metropolitan areas. Overscreening could be associated with health care access and patient-clinician relationships. Additional research on why overscreening persists and how to reduce overscreening is needed to minimize risks associated with cancer screening among older adults..",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.11645,Penn State College of Medicine,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Methods: Audits of 833 cytology request forms for low-risk women completing a Papanicolaou smear, from January 2008 to April 2011, from 5 Michigan family medicine clinics determined HPV orders completed by the clinician performing the Papanicolaou smear. Multivariate logistic regression models examined differences in HPV test ordering by patient age at Papanicolaou test, provider status and sex, and clinic across sites. A Poisson regression model analyzed the annual number of HPV test orders over time. Results: Cytology requests were completed by 622 faculty (75%), 169 residents/fellows (20%), and 42 nurse practitioner/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). HPV testing for any cytology result was ordered on 324 request forms (39%) by residents/fellows (48%), faculty (38%), and NP/PAs (10%). Female providers were twice as likely as men to order HPV testing for any cytology result across all clinics and provider statuses (P < .001). There were significant differences in HPV test ordering among clinics. Between 2008 and 2011 annual cytology requests increased 46%, including HPV testing for any cytology result after adjusting for faculty provider sex. Conclusion: HPV test ordering when cytology is collected varied by clinic and provider status and sex.

The Announcement Approach Training (AAT) has been shown to effectively increase HPV vaccine uptake by training providers to make strong vaccine recommendations and answer parents' common questions. Systems communications, like recall notices, can further improve HPV vaccination by reducing missed clinical opportunities for vaccination. Never tested in supporting HPV vaccination, the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model is a proven implementation strategy to increase best practices among healthcare providers. This trial uses a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design (type II) to evaluate two ECHO-delivered interventions intended to increase HPV vaccination rates. Methods: This 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 36 primary care clinics in Pennsylvania. Aim 1 evaluates the impact of HPV ECHO (AAT to providers) and HPV ECHO+ (AAT to providers plus recall notices to vaccine-declining parents) versus control on HPV vaccination (≥1 dose) among adolescents, ages 11–14, between baseline and 12-month follow-up (primary outcome). Using a convergent mixed-methods approach, Aim 2 evaluates the implementation of the HPV ECHO and HPV ECHO+ interventions. Aim 3 explores exposure to and impact of vaccine information from providers and other sources (e.g., social media) on secondary acceptance among 200 HPV vaccine-declining parents within 12 months. Discussion: We expect to demonstrate the effectiveness and evaluate the implementation of two highly scalable interventions to increase HPV vaccination in primary care clinics. Our study seeks to address the communication needs of both providers and parents, increase HPV vaccination, and, eventually, prevent HPV-related cancers.

Appalachian women with cervical cancer were compared to healthy Appalachian counterparts to determine whether these polymorphic alleles were over-represented within this high-risk cancer population, and whether lifestyle or environmental factors modified the aggregate genetic risk in these Appalachian women. Methods: Appalachian women’s survey data and blood samples from the Community Awareness, Resources, and Education (CARE) CARE I and CARE II studies (n = 163 invasive cervical cancer cases, 842 controls) were used to assess gene–environment interactions and cancer risk. Polymorphic allele frequencies and socio-behavioral demographic measurements were compared using t tests and χ2 tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate interaction effects between genomic variance and demographic, behavioral, and environmental characteristics. Results: Several alleles demonstrated significant interaction with smoking (TP53 rs1042522, TGFB1 rs1800469), alcohol consumption (NQO1 rs1800566), and sexual intercourse before the age of 18 (TGFBR1 rs11466445, TGFBR1 rs7034462, TGFBR1 rs11568785). Interestingly, we noted a significant interaction between “Appalachian self-identity” variables and NQO1 rs1800566. Multivariable logistic regression of cancer status in an over-dominant TGFB1 rs1800469/TGFBR1 rs11568785 model demonstrated a 3.03-fold reduction in cervical cancer odds. Similar decreased odds (2.78-fold) were observed in an over-dominant TGFB1 rs1800469/TGFBR1 rs7034462 model in subjects who had no sexual intercourse before age 18. Conclusions: This study reports novel associations between common low-penetrance alleles in the TGFB signaling cascade and modified risk of cervical cancer in Appalachian women. Furthermore, our unexpected findings associating Appalachian identity and NQO1 rs1800566 suggests that the complex environmental exposures that contribute to Appalachian self-identity in Appalachian cervical cancer patients represent an emerging avenue of scientific exploration.",10.1007/s10552-019-01221-y,The Ohio State University,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE To explore public knowledge, understanding of public health recommendations, perceptions, and trust in information sources related to COVID-19. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of central Pennsylvanian adults evaluated self-reported knowledge, and a convergent, mixed methods design was used to assess beliefs about recommendations, intended behaviors, perceptions, and concerns related to infectious disease risk, and trust of information sources. RESULTS The survey was completed by 5,948 adults. The estimated probability of correct response for the basic knowledge score, weighted with confidence, was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.80). Knowledge was significantly higher in patients with higher education and nonminority race. While the majority of respondents reported that they believed following CDC recommendations would decrease the spread of COVID-19 in their community and intended to adhere to them, only 65.2% rated social isolation with the highest level of belief and adherence. The most trusted information source was federal public health websites (42.8%). Qualitative responses aligned with quantitative data and described concerns about illness, epidemiologic issues, economic and societal disruptions, and distrust of the executive branch’s messaging. The survey was limited by a lack of minority representation, potential selection bias, and evolving COVID-19 information that may impact generalizability and interpretability. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge about COVID-19 and intended adherence to behavioral recommendations were high. There was substantial distrust of the executive branch of the federal government, however, and concern about mixed messaging and information overload. These findings highlight the importance of consistent messaging from trusted sources that reaches diverse groups.",10.1370/afm.2674,Pennsylvania State University,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Quantitatively, 89% of participants were up-to-date for cervical screening, and 65% for colorectal screening. Factors interacted such that compounding barriers were associated with lower odds of screening (e.g., insurance status and healthcare mistrust: interaction p =.02 for cervical; interaction p =.05 for colorectal). Qualitatively, three themes emerged regarding barriers to screening: privacy concerns, logistical barriers, and lack of trust in adequacy of healthcare services.

As states start lifting these mandates to reopen the economy, voluntary public compliance with public health recommendations may significantly influence the extent of resurgence in COVID-19 infection rates. Population-level risk from reopening may therefore be predicted from public intent to comply with public health recommendations. We are conducting a global, convergent design mixed-methods survey on public knowledge, perceptions, preferred health information sources, and understanding of and intent to comply with public health recommendations. With over 9,000 completed surveys from every US state and over 70 countries worldwide, to our knowledge this is the largest pandemic messaging study to date. Although the study is still ongoing, we have conducted an analysis of 5,005 US surveys completed from April 9-15, 2020 on public intent to comply with public health recommendations and offer insights on the COVID-19 pandemic-related risk of reopening. We found marked regional differences in intent to follow key public health recommendations. Regional efforts are urgently needed to influence public behavior changes to decrease the risk of reopening, particularly in higher-risk areas with low public intent to comply with preventive health recommendations.

Mack Ruffin,Self-sampling tools to increase cancer screening among underserved patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial,2024.0,JNCI Cancer Spectrum,Article,"screening underserved, screening outcomes, sampling tools, sampling screening, screening, self sampling, screening colorectal, screening cancer, cancer screening","2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.Background: Screening can reduce cancer mortality, but uptake is suboptimal and characterized by disparities. Home-based self-sampling can facilitate screening for colorectal cancer (with stool tests, eg, fecal immunochemical tests) and for cervical cancer (with self-collected human papillomavirus tests), especially among patients who face barriers to accessing health care. Additional data are needed on feasibility and potential effects of self-sampling tools for cancer screening among underserved patients. Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial with patients (female, ages 50-65 years, out of date with colorectal and cervical cancer screening) recruited from federally qualified health centers in rural and racially segregated counties in Pennsylvania. Participants in the standard-of-care arm (n = 24) received screening reminder letters. Participants in the self-sampling arm (n = 24) received self-sampling tools for fecal immunochemical tests and human papillomavirus testing. We assessed uptake of screening (10-week follow-up), self-sampling screening outcomes, and psychosocial variables. Analyses used Fisher exact tests to assess the effect of study arm on outcomes. Results: Cancer screening was higher in the self-sampling arm than the standard-of-care arm (colorectal: 75% vs 13%, respectively, odds ratio = 31.32, 95% confidence interval = 5.20 to 289.33; cervical: 79% vs 8%, odds ratio = 72.03, 95% confidence interval = 9.15 to 1141.41). Among participants who returned the self-sampling tools, the prevalence of abnormal findings was 24% for colorectal and 18% for cervical cancer screening. Cancer screening knowledge was positively associated with uptake (P <. 05). Conclusions: Self-sampling tools can increase colorectal and cervical cancer screening among unscreened, underserved patients. Increasing the use of self-sampling tools can improve primary care and cancer detection among underserved patients.

Mack Ruffin,Support for HPV vaccine school-entry requirements in the United States: The role of exemption policies,2022.0,Vaccine,Article,HPV vaccine; Parent attitudes; School vaccination requirements; United States; Vaccine exemption policies; HPV vaccine; Parent attitudes; School vaccination requirements; United States; Vaccine exemption policies,"2022 Elsevier LtdIn the United States (U.S.), only five states or territories require human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for school attendance, even though almost all U.S. jurisdictions have debated adopting this type of policy. In this U.S. based study, we sought to estimate the level of support for HPV vaccine school-entry requirements with varying exemption policies and documentation procedures to obtain exemptions. Between July and August 2019, we conducted a web-based survey with a national sample of 1,109 U.S. parents of 11- to 17-year-olds. The survey assessed support for four school-entry vaccine requirement policies: without exemption or with exemption for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Analyses used multivariable logistic regression to assess correlates of support for each policy. Overall, 38% of parents agreed with laws requiring HPV vaccination for school attendance without exemptions. When including exemption provisions, agreement increased to 45% for philosophical reasons, 50% for religious reasons, and 59% for medical reasons. Parents more often agreed on requirements without any exemptions if they were female (OR = 1.37, 95% CI:1.01–1.87), their child had initiated HPV vaccination (OR = 2.05, 95% CI:1.50–2.87), reported high levels of vaccine confidence (OR = 2.41, 95% CI:1.77–3.27), or reported having values similar to those of the people in their community (OR = 1.85, 95% CI:1.39–2.47). Parents more often agreed with requirements that included religious or philosophical exemptions if they reported having values similar to their community or high levels of psychological reactance (all p <.05). Many parents also supported requiring a written notice signed by a health care provider (40%) or religious leader (49%) to obtain a medical or religious exemption, respectively. In conclusion, exemption policies greatly increase parent support of school-entry requirements for HPV vaccination but may decrease their impact in practice. A large number of U.S. parents support strict documentation to obtain exemptions, signaling a promising area of policymaking to strengthen vaccine policies for school attendance.",10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.08.019,Penn State College of Medicine,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,
Mack Ruffin,Utilization of Mammography During the Last Year of Life Among Older Breast Cancer Survivors,2022.0,Journal of Women's Health,Article,breast cancer; end of life; mammography; Medicare; breast cancer; end of life; mammography; Medicare,"Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.Background: Mammography is generally recommended for breast cancer survivors. However, discussion is ongoing about stopping surveillance mammography when life expectancy is <5-10 years as the benefit of screening might be diminished toward the end of life. The utilization pattern of mammography in the last year of life among this population has not been well studied. Methods: We identified 58,736 females diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2002 and December 2015, who died at the age of at least 67, from the SEER-Medicare database. We examined the utilization patterns of mammography during their last year of life and investigated factors associated with the use of mammography at the end of life using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Overall, 28.5% of the patients received mammography during the last year of life. Multivariable logistic regression showed that older age (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.29-0.34, p < 0.001 for 95 vs. 85 years old), more advanced cancer stage (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.20-0.24 p < 0.001 for distant vs. localized disease), and higher comorbidity score (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.91-0.93, p < 0.001 for every 1-point increase) were associated with less mammography use. Age was nonlinearly associated with mammography use, with a steady proportion of patients receiving a mammography until approximately age 80 and then a sharp decrease thereafter. Conclusion: This population-based study found that a sizable proportion of older breast cancer survivors received mammography during the last year of life.",10.1089/jwh.2021.0517,Penn State College of Medicine,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

Mack Ruffin,Communication quality predicts patients’ colorectal cancer screening behavior,2024.0,Social Science and Medicine,Article,Colonoscopy; Colorectal cancer screening; Communication quality; Patient/Provider communication; United States,"2024 Elsevier LtdThe purpose of the present study was to investigate the quality of patient/clinician communication as one potential factor that impacts colorectal cancer screening behavior. As part of a larger randomized controlled trial conducted between 2011 and 2016 in the setting of community and academic family medicine or internal medicine practices in Michigan, USA, patients completed a pre-encounter survey, completed their regularly scheduled visit with their primary care clinician (which was audio-recorded), completed a post-encounter survey, and allowed 6-month follow-up chart audit. We trained 10 coders to rate 216 of the audio-recorded conversations between 216 patients and their primary care physicians for 6 specific features of communication quality (using 7-point scales), including the extent to which participants enacted attention to medical content, engagement, emotional expression, relationships, face, and accommodation. At least 3 coders rated each conversation, and intraclass correlations (i.e., reliability assessment) were in the good to excellent range. We found that patient and clinician attention to face (an identity goal) was a significant predictor of colorectal cancer screening at 6 months follow up. Measuring communication in terms of attention to multiple goals reveals unexpected findings about the aspects of communication that impact colorectal cancer screening behavior. The focus of many interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening rates is on the content (i.e., task goals) of clinicians' communication (such as presenting the different options for screening), yet the content of communication was not a significant predictor of screening in the present study. Rather, clinicians' and patients’ attention to identity goals predicted screening behavior, which suggests that interventions may not need to be overly complex and that simply improving the quality of attention to identity goals in clinician communication might be one of the most straightforward yet impactful ways to improve colorectal cancer screening uptake among patients.",10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117199,University of Kentucky,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,
Mack Ruffin,Predictors of Human Papillomavirus Seropositivity in Appalachian Women Aged 18 to 26 Years,2021.0,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,Article,"papillomavirus, papillomavirus hpv, hpv vaccination, hpv dna, appalachian women, antibodies hpv, human papillomavirus, seropositivity appalachian, papillomavirus seropositivity","Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.Background Key informants of the Appalachian community questioned whether their unique environmental stressors would alter their immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. The primary aim of this study is to determine predictors of HPV seroprevalence to at least 1 of the 4 vaccine-related HPV types before vaccination using a psychoneuroimmunologic model in Appalachian women. Method Women aged 18 to 26 years (n = 185) who had not received HPV vaccination provided cervical HPV DNA and blood samples. Human papillomavirus DNA was identified through Hybrid Capture 2 assay and then genotyped for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by Roche Linear Array. Competitive Luminex Immunoassay measured the type-specific antibodies to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in milli-Merck units per milliliter. Nine psychoneuroimmunology scales measuring attributes of stress were self-completed. Results Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 50% (92/183) of participants, with only 14% (26/183) positive for HPV-6/11/16/18 DNA. Seropositivity for at least one anti-HPV-6/11/16 or 18, on the other hand, was present in 35% (64/183) of women, with only 10% (19/183) concomitantly infected and seropositive for the vaccine-related types. The Perceived Stress Scale was not a strong predictor of HPV seropositivity. Conclusions Both HPV infection and vaccine-related HPV type seropositivity is common among Appalachian women aged 18 to 26 years. The anticipated effect of environmental stressors on HPV seropositivity was not seen when multiple predictors were considered.",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001416,Penn State Health Milton S.

Mack Ruffin,Examining Older Adults’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Cancer Screening and Overscreening: A Qualitative Study,2020.0,Journal of Primary Care and Community Health,Article,cancer; minority; overscreening; qualitative; screening,"The Author(s) 2020.Introduction/Objectives: Screening guidelines for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) are less clear for older adults due to the potential harms that may result from screening. Understanding older adults’ attitudes and perceptions, especially racial/ethnic minority and underserved adults, of cancer screening can help health care providers determine how best to communicate with older adults about cancer screening and screening cessation. The objective of this study was to determine how older adults primarily from minority/underserved backgrounds perceive cancer screening and overscreening. Methods: Four focus groups (n = 39) were conducted with adults (>=65 years of age) in 3 community settings in south-central Pennsylvania. Two focus groups were conducted in Spanish and translated to English upon transcription. Focus group data was managed and analyzed using QSR NVivo 12. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data where themes emerged following the coding process. Results: The focus group participants had an average age of 74 years and were primarily female (74%) and Hispanic (69%), with 69% reporting having less than a high school degree. Four key themes were identified from the focus groups: (1) importance of tailored and targeted education/information; (2) impact of physician/patient communication; (3) impact of barriers and facilitators to screening on cancer screening cessation; and (4) awareness of importance of screening. Participants were more likely to be agreeable to screening cessation if they received specific information regarding their health status and previous medical history from their physician as to why screening should be stopped and told by their physician that the screening decision is up to them. Conclusions: Older adults prefer individualized information from their physician in order to justify screening cessation but are against incorporating life expectancy into the discussion. Future research should focus on developing interventions to test the effectiveness of culturally tailored screening cessation messages for older adults.",10.1177/2150132720959234,Penn State College of Medicine,0000-0001-8336-478X,7006467693.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Positive psychology shows promise in improving positive affect and happiness. We tested a digital version of a positive psychology intervention called Three Good Things (3GT) among health care workers to assess whether gratitude practice improved well-being. METHODS All members of a large academic medicine department were invited. Participants were randomized to an immediate intervention group or control group (delayed intervention). Participants completed outcome measures surveys (demographics, depression, positive affect, gratitude, and life satisfaction) at baseline, and at 1 month and 3 months post-intervention. Controls completed additional surveys at 4 and 6 months (completion of the delayed intervention). During the intervention, we sent 3 text messages per week asking for 3GT that occurred that day. We used linear mixed models to compare the groups and to look at the effects of department role, sex, age, and time on outcomes. RESULTS Of 468 eligible individuals, 223 (48%) enrolled and were randomized with high retention through the end of the study. Most (87%) identified as female. For the intervention group, positive affect improved slightly at 1 month, then declined slightly but remained significantly improved at 3 months. Depression, gratitude, and life satisfaction scores showed a similar trend but were not statistically different between groups. CONCLUSIONS Our research showed adherence to a positive psychology intervention for health care workers created small positive improvements immediately post-intervention but were not sustained. Further work should evaluate whether utilizing different duration or intensity of the intervention improves benefits.",10.1370/afm.2963,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0495-5782,8276839400.0,

All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: Following the publication of Point-of-Care-Ultrasound (POCUS) curriculum guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians in 2016, there has been a rapid expansion in POCUS curricula across family medicine departments in the US. There is growing appreciation for the potential role of POCUS in enhancing the clinical care family physicians provide to patients. The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the utilization of POCUS in outpatient clinic care across Family Medicine departments nationwide and to identify perceived or realized barriers in integrating POCUS use for clinic care. Methods: The questions were part of a larger omnibus survey of US Department of Family Medicine chairs, conducted by the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) between August 6 to August 31, 2021. Results: 81% of departments have at least 1 POCUS-trained faculty, with 44% of departments using POCUS in some ambulatory clinical care. Currently, only 6% have established billing for the POCUS they perform. Faculty time, as well as funding, for POCUS training were seen as 2 primary barriers. The purchasing of equipment and billing for POCUS were described by FMCs as difficult. Conclusions: As POCUS use continues to rise in Family Medicine, it is imperative to create a more efficient and less hindered road to growth. Collaboration across departments to share best practices in training, purchasing equipment and billing for POCUS will be important to facilitate high-quality POCUS access for our patients.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.04.220019,Michigan Medicine,,57727206000.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for adults with chronic and acute illnesses informs health and economic policy for pandemic recovery. Our primary aim was to compare HRQoL of 3 illness groups of outpatient adults: Those with diabetes, those who survived a hospitalization for COVID-19, and those who had a respiratory virus not COVID-19. The secondary aim was to compare the group domain summary scores to the referent general population. Methods: We identified the 3 groups from the electronic medical record and invited them to complete the SF-36 survey. Analysis of variance and post hoc testing was used for univariate analyses followed by linear regression. Results: One hundred thirty-Two adults completed the survey. The groups differed least for physical functioning and most for emotional/mental health. The hospitalized group had the greatest limitation in role due to emotional issues. All groups had significantly lower social functioning scores than the general population. Linear regression showed lower HRQoL domain score in role limitations due to emotional issues adjusted for age, race, and gender for the hospitalized group.

The primary aim of our work was to evaluate the degree to which populations were accepting of home-based screenings for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cervical cancer (primary HPV testing). Three groups of adults having distinct health burdens which may affect acceptance of home-based cancer screening were identified through outpatient electronic medical records as follows as either having survived a COVID hospitalization, having been positive for non-COVID respiratory illness or having type 2 diabetes. 132 respondents (58% female) completed an online survey with hypothetical cases about their acceptance of home-based CRC or cervical cancer screening. Among females, urine and vaginal screening for primary HPV testing was acceptable to 64% and 59%, respectively. Among both males and females, CRC home screening with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or Cologuard was acceptable to 60% of the respondents. When adjusting for education, women with a positive attitude toward home-based urine /vaginal screening were 49 times and 23 times more likely to have a positive attitude toward CRC screening (aOR=48.7 (95% CI: 7.1, 337) and aOR=23.2 (95% CI: 3.8, 142), respectively). This report indicates that home-based cancer screens for CRC and primary HPV testing are acceptable to men and women and may allow for greater compliance with screening in the future.",10.1370/afm.20.s1.2639,,,57727206000.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction: Often misperceived as solely a dental disease, periodontitis is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the support structures of the tooth and associated with chronic systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Despite affecting almost 40% of US adults 30 years of age or older, periodontitis is rarely considered when quantifying the multimorbidity (the presence of 2 or more chronic conditions in an individual) burden for our patients. Multimorbidity represents a major challenge for primary care and is associated with increasing health care expenditure and increased hospitalizations. We hypothesized that periodontitis was associated with multimorbidity. Methods: To interrogate our hypothesis, we performed a secondary data analysis of a population-based cross-sectional survey, the NHANES 2011 to 2014 dataset. The study population included US adults aged 30 years or older who underwent a periodontal examination. Prevalence of periodontitis in individuals with and without multimorbidity was calculated using likelihood estimates and adjusting for confounding variables with logistic regression models. Results: Individuals with multimorbidity were more likely than the general population and individuals without multimorbidity to have periodontitis. However, in adjusted analyses, there was no independent association between periodontitis and multimorbidity. Given the absence of an association, we included periodontitis as a qualifying condition for the diagnosis of multimorbidity. As a result, the prevalence of multimorbidity in US adults 30 years and older increased from 54.1% to 65.8%. Discussion: Periodontitis is a highly prevalent, preventable chronic inflammatory condition. It shares many common risk factors with multimorbidity but was not independently associated with multimorbidity in our study. Further research is required to understand these observations and whether treating periodontitis in patients with multimorbidity may improve health care outcomes.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.220207R1,University of Michigan Medical School,,57727206000.0,

All rights reserved.Background: As the United States moves closer to a majority-minority, and a nearly equal male to female population, we should see a similar shift in the composition of leadership in the workplace. Family Medicine, while attempting to close the gaps, continues to fall short in producing women and minority leaders. Methods: The demographic traits of Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM) chairs in medical education institutions in the United States and Canada were analyzed. Results: The majority of those in chair positions were male (67%) and White (53%) non-Hispanic. Male chairs have been in positions significantly longer than females (average 9 years and 6 years, respectively). There was also a significant difference between chairs in public versus private schools-public, that is, chairs at public institutions had a much longer average time of 9 years in current position compared with those in private institutions had an average of 5 years. While the comparison was not significant, 46% of those that self-reported as non-White held chair positions at private schools compared with 28% of those that self-reported as White. Conclusions: Despite the availability of leadership pathways, women and underrepresented minorities continue to be underrepresented in these positions. Future research would benefit from a more extensive evaluation of different characteristics such as disability, gender identity and sexual orientation.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.05.220122,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9456-9518,57209309179.0,

Mckee,The Relationship Between Hearing Loss and Substance Use Disorders Among Adults in the U.S,2019.0,Am J Prev Med,Article,Hip; Ear; Hearing; Adult; Hip; Ear; Hearing; Adult,"2018 American Journal of Preventive MedicineIntroduction: Hearing loss is common and associated with poorer health and impeded communication. Little is known about the association between hearing loss and substance use disorders in the general population. The objective of this study was to assess substance use disorder prevalence among individuals with hearing loss, versus those without hearing loss, in a nationally representative sample of adults. Methods: Two years (2015 and 2016) of National Survey on Drug Use and Health (unweighted N=86,186) were combined to compare substance use disorders among adults with and without self-reported hearing loss. Statistical analysis included descriptive frequencies, chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regressions. Analyses were performed in 2018. Results: Hearing loss prevalence across all age groups was 5.2%. Among younger age groups, after adjusting for sociodemographics, hearing loss was independently associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing a substance use disorder (ages 18–34 years, AOR=1.34, 95% CI=1.10, 1.64 vs 35–49 years, AOR=1.87, 95% CI=1.39, 2.53). Hearing loss was also associated with a greater likelihood of a prescription opioid use disorder (AOR=2.85, 95% CI=1.86, 4.39) in the group aged 18–34 years and, for the group aged 35–49 years, hearing loss increased the likelihood of both an alcohol use disorder (AOR=1.87, 95% CI=1.39, 2.53) and a prescription opioid use disorder (AOR=1.99, 95% CI=1.01, 3.91). Conclusions: Hearing loss is independently associated with substance use disorders among those aged 49 years and younger; these associations are particularly pronounced for prescription opioid use disorders in the group aged 18–34 years. Given the concern of inappropriate use of prescription opioids, this information may have implications for healthcare providers’ pain management for patients with hearing loss.",10.1016/j.amepre.2018.10.026.,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,4824740.0

Thieme. All rights reserved.Objective Hearing loss is increasingly prevalent among younger adults, impacting health and health care use. Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) women have a higher risk of chronic diseases, pregnancy complications, and adverse birth outcomes compared with hearing women. Health care utilization patterns during the perinatal period remain not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine differences in antenatal emergency department and inpatient utilization among DHH and non-DHH women. Study Design We conducted a retrospective cohort study design to analyze 2002 to 2013 Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal data to compare antenatal inpatient and emergency department use between DHH (N = 925) and hearing (N = 2,895) women with singleton deliveries. Matching was done based on delivery year, age at delivery, and birth parity in 1:3 case-control ratio. Demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and hospital characteristics were first compared for DHH mothers and the matched control group using chi-squared tests and t -tests. Multivariable models were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Results Among DHH women (N = 925), 49% had at least one emergency department visit, 19% had an observational stay, and 14% had a nondelivery hospital stay compared with 26, 14, and 6%, respectively, among hearing women (N = 28,95) during the antenatal period (all p s < 0.001). The risk of nondelivery emergency department visits (risk ratio [RR] 1.58; p < 0.001) and inpatient stays (RR = 1.89; p < 0.001) remained higher among DHH women compared with hearing women even after adjustment. Having four or more antenatal emergency department visits (7 vs. 2%) and two or more nondelivery hospital stays (4 vs. 0.4%) were more common among pregnant DHH women compared with their controls (all p -values < 0.001). Conclusion The findings demonstrate that DHH women use emergency departments and inpatient services at a significantly higher rate than their hearing controls during the antenatal period. A systematic investigation of the mechanisms for these findings are needed. Key Points Antenatal emergency department use is significantly higher among deaf and hard of hearing women. Antenatal hospitalizations are significantly higher among deaf and hard of hearing women. Hearing loss screening may identify those at risk for adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes.",10.1055/a-2053-7439,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,2303102743.0

All rights reserved.When physicians have a disability or chronic condition, they can offer deeper insight and ability into managing the needs of patients with similar conditions. Yet an alarming 2021 survey found that only 40.7% of physicians feel confident that they provide the same level of care to people with disabilities (PWD) as those without. This may contribute to troubling health care disparities for the over 61 million Americans living with disabilities. In a recent report, The American Medical Association (AMA) recognized that increased concordance between patients and physicians with disabilities is key to resolving health care inequities for PWD, yet although 1 in 5 patients reports a disability, only 1 in 33 physicians identifies as such. This is because prospective medical students with disabilities face many barriers in medical education and practice.

This study sought to develop consensus-based domains for a preconception education curriculum for people with mobility disabilities. Methods: We used a mixed methods approach, including a literature review and a Delphi method to develop consensus. Delphi panel members and domains were identified by a systematic review and purposive sampling and included physicians, researchers, and individuals with lived experience of mobility disabilities. A Delphi method was used to reach consensus on domains for a preconception education curriculum for people with mobility disabilities. Results: The systematic review identified 53 domains of preconception health education. Seventeen individuals participated in the Delphi panel process. After three rounds of quantitative and qualitative consensus feedback, 13 educational domains were selected for preconception education for people with mobility disabilities. The domains were 1) Pregnancy Interest; 2) Infertility and Obstetric History; 3) Genetic History and Screening; 4) Medical History; 5) Medication History; 6) Mental Health History; 7) Nutrition and Weight History; 8) Social Determinants of Health; 9) Intimate Partner Violence and Caregiver Abuse; 10) Functional Mobility and Physical Accommodations; 11) Musculoskeletal and Skin Health; 12) Bowel and Bladder Surgery; and 13) Neurological and Neurosurgical History. Conclusions: A consensus preconception education curriculum for people with mobility disabilities include standard domains plus additional domains focused on functional mobility and physical accommodations: musculoskeletal and skin health, bowel and bladder surgery, and neurological and neurosurgical history.",10.1016/j.whi.2024.11.001,Norton College of Medicine,0000-0002-5561-9885,37124462900.0,

All rights reserved.OBJECTIVE:To evaluate contraceptive provision and contraceptive care quality measures for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and compare these outcomes to those individuals who are not.METHODS:We conducted a claims analysis with data from the 2014 Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database. Among premenopausal enrollees aged 15-44, we determined provision of any contraception (yes or no) and provision by contraception type: prescription contraception (pills, patch, ring, injectables, or diaphragm), long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) devices, and permanent contraception (tubal sterilization). We compared these outcomes by deaf or hard-of-hearing status (yes or no). The odds of contraceptive provision were calculated with regression models adjusted for age, Medicaid insurance, a preventive health visit, and deaf or hard-of-hearing status. We calculated contraceptive care quality measures, per the U.S. Office of Population Health, as the percentage of enrollees who used: 1) LARC methods or 2) most effective or moderately effective methods (tubal sterilization, pills, patch, ring, injectables, or diaphragm).RESULTS:We identified 1,171,838 enrollees at risk for pregnancy; 13,400 (1.1%) were deaf or hard of hearing. Among individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing, 31.4% were provided contraception (23.5% prescription contraception, 5.4% LARC, 0.7% tubal sterilization). Individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing were less likely to receive prescription contraception (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96) than individuals who were not deaf or hard of hearing. The percentage of individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing who received most effective or moderately effective methods was less than that for individuals who were not (24.2% vs 26.3%, P<.001). There were no differences in provision of LARC or permanent contraception by deaf and hard-of-hearing status.CONCLUSION:Individuals who were deaf or hard of hearing were less likely to receive prescription contraception than individuals who were not; factors underlying this pattern need to be examined. Provision of LARC or permanent contraception did not differ by deaf or hard-of-hearing status. These findings should be monitored and compared with data from states with different requirements for contraceptive coverage.",10.1097/AOG.0000000000004505,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,2146666047.0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America. All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: Hearing loss (HL) is common among older adults and is associated with significant psychosocial, cognitive, and physical sequelae. Hearing aids (HA) can help, but not all individuals with HL use them. This study examines how social determinants may impact HA use. Research Design and Methods: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study involving a secondary analysis of a nationally representative data set, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; n = 35,572). This was followed up with 1:1 qualitative interviews (n = 21) with community participants to clarify our findings. Both samples included individuals aged 55 and older with a self-reported HL, with or without HA. The main outcome measure was the proportion of participants with a self-reported HL who use HA. Results and Discussion: Analysis of HRS data indicated that younger, nonwhite, non-Hispanic, lower income, and less-educated individuals were significantly less likely to use HA than their referent groups (all p values <. 001). Area of residence (e.g., urban) were not significantly associated with HA use. Qualitative findings revealed barriers to HA included cost, stigma, vanity, and a general low priority placed on addressing HL by health care providers. Facilitators to obtaining and using HA included family/friend support, knowledge, and adequate insurance coverage for HA. Implications: Many socioeconomic factors hinder individuals' ability to obtain and use HA, but these obstacles appeared to be mitigated in part when insurance plans provided adequate HA coverage, or when their family/friends provided encouragement to use HA.",10.1093/geront/gny051,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,

Yet, existing programs are not suitable for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) youth. Moreover, little research has examined the use of the full range of tobacco products and related knowledge in this group. To address this gap and inform development of a school-based tobacco prevention program for this population, we conducted a pilot study among DHH middle school (MS) and high school (HS) students attending Schools for the Deaf and mainstream schools in California (n = 114). American Sign Language (ASL) administered surveys, before and after receipt of a draft curriculum delivered by health or physical education teachers, assessed product use and tobacco knowledge. Thirty-five percent of students reported exposure to tobacco products at home, including cigarettes (19%) and e-cigarettes (15%). Tobacco knowledge at baseline was limited; 35% of students knew e-cigarettes contain nicotine, and 56% were aware vaping is prohibited on school grounds. Current product use was reported by 16% of students, most commonly e-cigarettes (12%) and cigarettes (10%); overall, 7% of students reported dual use. Use was greater among HS versus MS students. Changes in student knowledge following program delivery included increased understanding of harmful chemicals in tobacco products, including nicotine in e-cigarettes.

Academic Emergency Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.Objective: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) patients are understudied in emergency medicine health services research. Theory and limited evidence suggest that DHH patients are at higher risk of emergency department (ED) utilization and poorer quality of care. This study assessed ED condition acuity, length of stay (LOS), and acute ED revisits among DHH patients. We hypothesized that DHH patients would experience poorer ED care outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of a single health care system using data from a large academic medical center in the southeast United States. Data were received from the medical center's data office, and we sampled patients and encounters from between June 2011 and April 2020. We compared DHH American Sign Language (ASL) users (n = 108), DHH English speakers (n = 358), and non-DHH English speakers (n = 302). We used multilevel modeling to assess the differences among patient segments in outcomes related to ED use and care. Results: As hypothesized, DHH ASL users had longer ED LOS than non-DHH English speakers, on average 30 min longer. Differences in ED condition acuity, measured through Emergency Severity Index and triage pain scale, were not statistically significant. DHH English speakers represented a majority (61%) of acute ED revisit encounters. Conclusions: Our study identified that DHH ASL users have longer ED LOS than non-DHH English speakers. Additional research is needed to further explain the association between DHH status and ED care outcomes (including ED LOS and acute revisit), which may be used to identify intervention targets to improve health equity.",10.1111/acem.14573,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) patients are a priority population for emergency medicine health services research. DHH patients are at higher risk than non-DHH patients of using the emergency department (ED), have longer lengths of stay in the ED and report poor patient–provider communication. This qualitative study aimed to describe ED care-seeking and patient-centred care perspectives among DHH patients. Methods: This qualitative study is the second phase of a mixed-methods study. The goal of this study was to further explain quantitative findings related to ED outcomes among DHH and non-DHH patients. We conducted semistructured interviews with 4 DHH American Sign Language (ASL)-users and 6 DHH English speakers from North Central Florida. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a descriptive qualitative approach. Results: Two themes were developed: (1) DHH patients engage in a complex decision-making process to determine ED utilization and (2) patient-centred ED care differs between DHH ASL-users and DHH English speakers. The first theme describes the social-behavioural processes through which DHH patients assess their need to use the ED. The second theme focuses on the social environment within the ED: patients feeling stereotyped, involvement in the care process, pain communication, receipt of accommodations and discharge processes. Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of better understanding, and intervening in, DHH patient ED care-seeking and care delivery to improve patient outcomes. Like other studies, this study also finds that DHH patients are not a monolithic group and language status is an equity-relevant indicator. We also discuss recommendations for emergency medicine. Patient or Public Contribution: This study convened a community advisory group made up of four DHH people to assist in developing research questions, data collection tools and validation of the analysis and interpretation of data.

The objective of this study was to summarize the pandemic-related work experiences of sign language interpreters and interpreting administrators upon transitioning from on-site to remote work. Methods: From March through August 2021, we conducted focus groups with 22 sign language interpreters in 5 settings, 1 focus group for each setting: staff, educational, community/freelance, video remote interpreting, and video relay services. We also conducted 5 individual interviews with interpreting administrators or individuals in positions of administrative leadership in each represented setting. The 22 interpreters had a mean (SD) age of 43.4 (9.8) years, 18 were female, 17 were White, all identified as hearing, and all worked a mean (SD) of 30.6 (11.6) hours per week in remote interpreting. We asked participants about the positive and negative consequences of transitioning from on-site to remote at-home interpreting. We established a thematic framework by way of qualitative description for data analysis. Results: We found considerable overlap across positive and negative consequences identified by interpreters and interpreting administrators. Positive consequences of transitioning from on-site to remote-at-home interpreting were realized across 5 overarching topic areas: organizational support, new opportunities, well-being, connections/relationships, and scheduling. Negative consequences emerged across 4 overarching topic areas: technology, financial aspects, availability of the interpreter workforce, and concerns about the occupational health of interpreters. Conclusions: The positive and negative consequences shared by interpreters and interpreting administrators provide foundational knowledge upon which to create recommendations for the anticipated sustainment of some remote interpreting practice in a manner that protects and promotes occupational health.",10.1177/00333549231173941,University of Rochester,0000-0002-5561-9885,37124462900.0,

This study explores the pregnancy experiences of women who are deaf to better understand their barriers to and facilitators of optimal pregnancy-related health care. Design: Qualitative study using thematic analysis. Setting: Semi-structured, individual, remote or in-person interviews conducted in the USA. Sample: Forty-five women who are deaf and communicate using American Sign Language (ASL) and gave birth in the USA within the past 5 years participated in the interviews. Methods: Semi-structured interviews explored how mothers who are deaf experienced pregnancy and birth, including access to perinatal information and resources, relationships with healthcare providers, communication access and their involvement with the healthcare system throughout pregnancy. A thematic analysis was conducted. Main outcome measures: Barriers and facilitators related to a positive experience of perinatal care access among women who are deaf. Results: Three major themes emerged: (1) communication accessibility; (2) communication satisfaction; and (3) healthcare provider and team support. Common barriers included choosing healthcare providers, inconsistent communication access and difficulty accessing health information. However, when women who are deaf were able to use ASL interpreters, they had more positive pregnancy and birth experiences. Self-advocacy served as a common facilitator for more positive pregnancy and healthcare experiences. Conclusions: Healthcare providers need to be more aware of the communication and support needs of their patients who are deaf, especially how to communicate effectively.

Objective Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of sterilization for women with physical/sensory disabilities, and compare this to the prevalence for women without disabilities. We also compared use of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods between women with and without disabilities. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth 2011–2013, a population-based survey of U.S. women aged 15–44. Bivariate comparisons between women with and without disabilities by female sterilization and LARC use were conducted using chi-square tests. Using logistic regression, we estimated the odds of female sterilization based upon disability status. Results Women with physical/sensory disabilities accounted for 9.3% of the total sample (N = 4966). Among women with disabilities only, 28.2% had undergone female sterilization, representing 1.2 million women nationally. LARC use was lower among women with disabilities than those without disabilities (5.4%, 9.3%, respectively, p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, insurance, marital status, parity, and self-reported health, women with disabilities had higher odds of sterilization (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03, 1.79).

Limited research has been conducted on healthcare communication during pregnancy. This study's aim was to assess communication accommodations and experiences during pregnancy for DHH people. Methods: An accessible web-based survey was administered to a non-probability sample of DHH people through national organizations, social media, and snowball sampling. Eligibility criteria included being 21 years or older; given birth in the U.S. within the past 10 years, report hearing loss prior to the most recent birth. Questions focused on healthcare experiences and information access during their last pregnancy. The sample included 583 respondents for the present analysis. We describe the communication accommodations requested and received during pregnancy, segmented by preferred language. Results: Most DHH participants reported communication with prenatal clinicians as “good” or “very good”. On-site interpreter services were most commonly requested by American Sign Language (ASL) only and bilingual DHH people. Interpersonal communication modification requests (e.g., speaking louder) were rarely obliged. Conclusion: This study is the first national examination of requested and received communication accommodations for DHH patients during the perinatal period.

It is unknown if the same effect is seen among Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users who face communication barriers in health care settings. Objective We sought to examine whether educational attainment and/or annual household income were inversely associated with cardiovascular risk in a sample of Deaf ASL users. Methods This cross-sectional study included 302 Deaf respondents aged 18-88 years from the Deaf Health Survey (2008), an adapted and translated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) administered in sign language. Associations between the self-reported cardiovascular disease equivalents (CVDE; any of the following: diabetes, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular attack (CVA), and angina) with educational attainment (≤high school [low education], some college, and ≥4 year college degree [referent]), and annual household income (<$25,000, $25,000-<$50,000, or ≥$50,000 [referent]) were assessed using a multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking history. Results Deaf respondents who reported ≤high school education were more likely to report the presence of a CVDE (OR = 5.76; 95% CI = 2.04-16.31) compared to Deaf respondents who reported having ≥4 year college degree after adjustment. However, low-income Deaf individuals (i.e., household incomes <$25,000) were not more likely to report the presence of a CVDE (OR = 2.24; 95% CI = 0.76-6.68) compared to high-income Deaf respondents after adjustment. Conclusion Low educational attainment was associated with higher likelihood of reported cardiovascular equivalents among Deaf individuals. Higher income did not appear to provide a cardiovascular protective effect for Deaf respondents. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It is unknown how this affected the deaf population, a sociolinguistic minority group that continues to face communication and healthcare barriers. The survey's objective was to describe the deaf participants’ experiences with telehealth visits. Methods: A 28-item online survey, available in American Sign Language and English, was developed and disseminated between November 2020 and January 2021. Ninety-nine deaf participants responded. Descriptive statistics were performed to assess the participant's virtual health care use, experiences, and communication approaches. Results: Seventy-five percent of respondents used telehealth at least once in the past 12 months (n = 74; age = 37.6 ± 14.5 years). Of those who used telehealth, nearly two-thirds experienced communication challenges (65.3%; n = 49). Half of the participants reported having to connect via a video relay service that employs interpreters who maintain general certification instead of a remote interpreter with specialized health care interpreting certifications for video visits with their health care providers (n = 37) and a third of participants reported needing to use their residual hearing to communicate with their providers (n = 25). Conclusion: Standard protocols for health care systems and providers are needed to minimize the burden of access on deaf patients and ensure virtual visits are equitable. It is recommended these visits be offered on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms and include multi-way video to allow for the inclusion of remote medical interpreters and/or real-time captionists to ensure effective communication between the provider and the deaf patient occurs.",10.1177/1357633X221074863,National Technical Institute for the Deaf,0000-0002-5561-9885,37124462900.0,

These outcomes are likely exacerbated for Black DHH women because of the intersection of disability and race. This study aimed to explore the pregnancy and birth experiences of Black DHH women to identify factors that influence their pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted between 2018 and 2019 with 67 DHH women who gave birth in the past five years. The present study represents a subgroup analysis of eight of the 67 women who self-identified as Black. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for emerging themes. Results: Primary themes centered on unmet needs, barriers, and facilitators. Barriers included limited access to health information owing to communication difficulties and challenges obtaining accommodations. Key facilitators included the availability of sign language interpreters, familial support, and cultural understanding from providers. Participants emphasized these facilitators in their recommendations to providers and DHH women. Findings also underscored the critical role of recognizing cultural identity in perinatal health care delivery. Conclusions: This study outlines themes that affect pregnancy and birthing experiences among Black DHH women in the United States. Study implications include a call to action for providers to prioritize communication accommodations, accessible information, and compassionate care for all Black DHH women. Furthermore, future work should explore the impact of cultural and racial concordance between patients and their health care providers and staff. Understanding how intersectional identities affect perinatal health care access is crucial for reducing disparities among Black DHH women.",10.1016/j.whi.2023.07.005,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,37124462900.0,

However, little is known about postpartum outcomes among DHH women. The objective was to compare the risk of postpartum hospitalizations for DHH compared with non-DHH women and the leading indications for postpartum admissions. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the 1998-2017 Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal Data System and identified 3,546 singleton deliveries to DHH women and 1,381,439 singleton deliveries to non-DHH women. We used Cox proportional hazard models to compare the first hospital admission and ≥2 hospital admissions between DHH and non-DHH women within 1-42, 43-90, and 91-365 days after delivery. Results: DHH women had a higher risk for any hospital admissions across all periods (hazard ratios [HR] = 1.84; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.46-2.34 within 1-42 days; HR = 2.76; 95%CI 1.99-3.83 within 43-90 days; and HR = 3.10; 95%CI 2.66-3.60 91-365 days) after childbirth compared with non-DHH women. They had an almost seven times higher risk for repeated hospital admissions within 43-90 days (HR = 6.84; 95%CI 1.66-28.21) and nearly four times higher the risk within 91-365 days (HR = 3.63; 95%CI 2.00-6.59) after delivery compared with non-DHH women. The leading indications for readmission among DHH women included: conditions complicating the puerperium/hemorrhage and soft tissues disorders. Conclusion: Compared with other women, DHH women had significantly higher readmissions across all postpartum periods and for repeated admissions >42 days.

Michael Matthew Mckee,"Pregnancy, Birth, and Infant Outcomes Among Women Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing",2020.0,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,Article,Ear; Hearing; Pregnancy; Infant,"2019 American Journal of Preventive MedicineIntroduction: Being deaf or hard of hearing can be marginalizing and associated with inequitable health outcomes. Until recently, there were no U.S. population-based studies of pregnancy outcomes among deaf or hard of hearing women. In light of inconsistent findings in the limited available literature, this study sought to conduct a more rigorous study using population-based, longitudinal linked data to compare pregnancy complications, birth characteristics, and neonatal outcomes between deaf or hard of hearing and non-deaf or hard of hearing women. Methods: Researchers conducted a retrospective cohort study in 2019 using the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal data system. This system links all Massachusetts birth certificates, fetal death reports, and delivery- and nondelivery-related hospital discharge records for all infants and their mothers. The study included women with singleton deliveries who gave birth in Massachusetts between January 1998 and December 2013. Results: The deaf or hard of hearing women had an increased risk of chronic medical conditions and pregnancy complications including pre-existing diabetes, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and placental abruption. Deliveries to deaf or hard of hearing women were significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight or very low weight, and low 1-minute Apgar score or low 5-minute Apgar score. No significant differences were found in size for gestational age, fetal distress, or stillbirth among deaf or hard of hearing women. Conclusions: Findings from this 2019 study indicate that deaf or hard of hearing women are at a heightened risk for chronic conditions, pregnancy-related complications, and adverse birth outcomes and underscore the need for systematic investigation of the pregnancy- and neonatal-related risks, complications, costs, mechanisms, and outcomes of deaf or hard of hearing women.",10.1016/j.amepre.2019.10.012,Brandeis University,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,
Michael Matthew Mckee,Prevalence of intellectual disability among adults born in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States,2024.0,Journal of Intellectual Disability Research,Article,Adult; Adult; Intellectual disability; Prevalence,"2024 The Authors. Journal of Intellectual Disability Research published by John Wiley & Sons and MENCAP.Background: Prevalence of intellectual disability (ID) is currently estimated through parent report on surveys of children. It is difficult to estimate the number of adults living with ID in the United States because no comprehensive survey or surveillance allows for identification. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and number of adults with ID born between 1980 and 1999 using multiple years of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Census data. Methods: We concatenated the NHIS from 1997–2016 that evaluated parental response about whether a child aged 3–17 years had an ID. Using weighted survey analyses, we estimated the prevalence of ID among individuals across four birth cohorts—(1) 1980–1984, (2) 1985–1989, (3) 1990–1994, and (4) 1995–1999. The number of adults with ID was then extrapolated by applying these prevalence rates to Census population estimates (as of 1 July 2021) of respective birth cohorts. Results: Weighted prevalence of ID varied by birth cohort, sex, race and ethnicity, and US Census Bureau regions. The overall prevalence rate was 1.066 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.831–1.302] for adults born between 1980 and 1984, 0.772 (CI: 0.654–0.891) for adults born between 1985 and 1989, 0.774 (0.675–0.874) for adults born between 1990 and 1994, and 1.069 (CI: 0.898–1.240) for adults born between 1995 and 1999. Overall, we estimate that 818 564 adults with ID who were approximately 21–41 years were living in the United States as of 2021. Conclusions: This study provides researchers examining adult health outcomes with an estimated denominator of young and middle-aged adults living with ID in the United States. Policymakers can use this information to support justification for resource and service needs, and clinicians may benefit from understanding that ID is a lifelong developmental condition often with additional physical, emotional and developmental needs requiring tailored care.",10.1111/jir.13119,Augusta University,0000-0002-5561-9885,37124462900.0,

This study compared rates of SMM during delivery and postpartum among DHH and non-DHH women. Methods: This nationally representative retrospective cohort study used hospital discharge data from the 2004–2020 Health Care and Cost Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The risk of SMM with and without blood transfusion during delivery and postpartum among DHH and non-DHH women were compared using modified Poisson regression analysis. The study was conducted in the United States in 2022–2023. Results: The cohort included 9351 births to DHH women for the study period, and 13,574,382 age-matched and delivery year-matched births to non-DHH women in a 1:3 case-control ratio. The main outcomes were SMM and non-transfusion SMM during delivery and postpartum. Relative risks were sequentially adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, hospital-level characteristics, and clinical characteristics. In unadjusted analyses, DHH women were at 80% higher risk for SMM (RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.63–2.02, p < 0.001) during delivery and postpartum compared to non-DHH women. Adjustment for socio-demographic and hospital characteristics attenuated risk for SMM (RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.38–1.72, p < 0.001). Adjustment for the Elixhauser comorbidity score further attenuated the risk of SMM among DHH women (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.26, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate a critical need for inclusive preconception, prenatal, and postpartum care that address conditions that increase the risk for SMM among DHH people.",10.1016/j.ypmed.2024.107883,Brandeis University,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Individuals with hearing loss (HL) are at higher risk for hospitalizations, and may be for readmissions, compared with their hearing peers. The objective of this prospective study was to confirm retrospective studies suggesting that HL increases hospital readmissions, and, if confirmed, possible causes for it. Methods: A prospective cohort study of English-speaking patients >55 years old admitted to general medical and surgical floors at 2 large hospital systems in southeastern Michigan over a 2-year period was conducted. All patients underwent bedside audiometric testing. HL presence and severity were categorized using World Health Organization pure tone assessment parameters. Readmission rates, Charlson comorbidity index, socio-demographic and medical variables were obtained from Epic EMR databases. Outcomes: There were 1247 hospitalized patients enrolled. Of these, 76.8% had documented HL of which 50.5% (630) was mild HL and 26.3% (328) moderate or worse HL. Patients with any HL were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic, white, male, and had less education, lower health literacy, more comorbidities, and more difficulty communicating with their doctor. Readmission rates at 30 and 90-days were similar between HL and hearing groups, after adjusting for HL severity, Charlston index, and numerous potential confounders. Conclusion: Patients with HL do not seem to have higher rates of hospital readmissions. We did find high frequency of HL in hospitalized patients along with significant communication difficulties that patients had with their clinicians.

Preventing or delaying pregnancy when that is the best choice for a woman is a critical strategy to reducing pregnancy-related disparities, yet little is known about current contraceptive use among women with disabilities. METHODS: A cohort of 545 reproductive-age women with physical disabilities (i.e., difficulty walking, climbing, dressing or bathing) or sensory disabilities (i.e., difficulty with vision or hearing) was identified from among participants in the 2011–2013 National Survey of Family Growth. Those at risk for unplanned pregnancy were categorized by whether they were using highly effective reversible contraceptive methods (IUD, implant), moderately effective ones (pill, patch, ring, injectable), less effective ones (condoms, withdrawal, spermicides, diaphragm, natural family planning) or no method. Multinomial regression was conducted to examine the association between disability and type of contraceptive used. RESULTS: Some 39% of women with disabilities were at risk of unplanned pregnancy, and 27% of those at risk were not using contraceptives. The presence of disability was associated with decreased odds of using highly effective methods or moderately effective methods, rather than less effective ones (odds ratio, 0.6 for each), but had no association with using no method. CONCLUSION: There is a significant need to reduce contraceptive disparities related to physical or sensory disabilities.

What's Going On?— Pregnancy Experiences of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Mothers Who Do Not Sign",2024.0,Birth,Article,Ear; Hearing; Pregnancy; hearing loss; maternal health; perinatal care; qualitative research,"2024 The Author(s). Birth published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.Objective: Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) women experience higher rates of reproductive healthcare barriers and adverse birth outcomes compared to their hearing peers. This study explores the pregnancy experiences of DHH women who do not sign to better understand their barriers and facilitators to optimal perinatal health care. Design: Qualitative study using thematic analysis. Setting: Semi-structured, individual remote, or in-person interviews in the United States. Sample: Twenty-two DHH English speakers (non-signers) who gave birth in the United States within the past 5 years. Methods: Semi-structured interviews explored how DHH women experienced pregnancy and birth, including access to perinatal information and resources, relationships with healthcare providers, communication access, and their involvement with the healthcare system throughout pregnancy. A thematic analysis was conducted. Main Outcome Measures: The barriers and facilitators related to a positive perinatal care experience among DHH women. Results: Five key themes emerged. For barriers, healthcare communication breakdowns and loss of patient autonomy highlighted DHH women's struggle with perinatal health care. In contrast, DHH participants outlined the importance of accessible health communication practices and accommodations, use of patient advocacy or self-advocacy, and assistive technologies for DHH parents for more positive perinatal care experiences. Conclusions: Perinatal healthcare providers and staff should routinely inquire about ways to ensure an inclusive and accessible healthcare experience for their DHH patients and provide communication accommodations for optimal care. Additionally, healthcare providers should be more aware of the unique parenting needs and resources of their DHH patients.",10.1111/birt.12881,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,37124462900.0,

Participants and Methods: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted from September 1, 2022 to February 2, 2023, among privately insured beneficiaries if they had an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision or 10th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code for TSCI (n=9081). Incidence estimates of serious and life-threatening morbidities, and more common secondary and long-term health conditions, were compared at 5 years of enrollment. Survival models were used to quantify unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for serious and life-threatening morbidities. Results: Adults living with TSCI and T2D had a higher incidence of all of the morbidities assessed as compared with nondiabetic adults with TSCI. Fully adjusted survival models reported that adults with TSCI and T2D had a greater hazard for most of the serious and life-threatening conditions assessed, including sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.65), myocardial infarction (HR: 1.63), osteomyelitis (HR: 1.9), and stroke or transient ischemic attack (HR: 1.59). Rates for comorbid and secondary conditions were higher for individuals with TSCI and T2D, such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, and depression, even after controlling for sociodemographic and comorbid conditions. Conclusion: Adults living with TSCI and T2D have a significantly higher incidence of and risk of developing serious and life-threatening morbidities as compared with nondiabetic adults with TSCI.",10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2023.08.002,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,37124462900.0,

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess self-rated comprehension and overall satisfaction with video versus face-to-face neonatal discharge instructions in first-time mothers. RESULTS: Video instructions were no different from face-to-face instructions, though there was a nonsignificant increase in confidence in caring for their newborn in the video group. CONCLUSIONS: Broader use of technology may allow for a more standard-ized approach to patient education and improve efficiency for clinicians, without compromising patient satisfaction and confidence in caring for them-selves and their dependents.",10.22454/FamMed.2021.551065,Trinity Health Michigan,,57204460049.0,

Domains assessed included perceived pandemic threat; value, existence, and barriers to creating personal disaster plans; staff absenteeism estimates; barriers to work attendance. Quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis with identification and coding of common themes, respectively.Results All 12 invited leaders participated and believed a personal disaster plan was important but only 2 had plans. None had ever discussed with their staff the importance of having a personal disaster plan. Two common barriers in creating a plan were low threat perception level and never considering the possibility of pandemic influenza. Only half of respondents could list common barriers preventing staff from working. Staff were confident employees would come to work during a disaster.Conclusion Outpatient primary care leaders may hold misconceptions regarding future disasters, underestimate their potential impact on clinics, and lack personal preparedness. Further investigation and interventions are needed to ensure clinics can be prepared so they can function and help hospital and emergency services when disasters strike.

In the past, illicit marijuana use had positive correlations with other health risk behaviors. It is not known whether access to CTP has shifted patterns of use and altered health outcomes. Objective: To describe the self-reported patterns of CTP use among individuals with SCI and correlations with health behaviors and health indicators. Method: Secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study involving community-dwelling individuals with chronic SCI and neurogenic bladder and bowel, at least 5 years post injury. Data were collected via structured interviews. Results: 92.2% of the current sample (n = 244) lived in states that, at the time of the study, permitted the use of CTP. 22.5% reported using CTP at least monthly to relieve pain (70.4%) and spasticity (46.3%). Of those 54 participants, 52.7% were daily users. Whereas 23.0% of non-CTP users endorsed having prescriptions for at least one opioid-based medication, 38.1% of CTP users did so, suggesting that CTP use does not mitigate opioid use. Users were more likely to be single and live alone, report more bladder complications, and perceive their psychosocial functioning as more compromised than non-users. Conclusion: A relatively large percentage of individuals with chronic SCI appear to use CTP on a regular basis. Results suggest that they may be more vulnerable to complications and to risk factors for substance use disorders in SCI, such as social isolation. Although the generalizability of these fndings is limited by the sampling strategies and the eligibility criteria of the larger study, CTP use should be assessed and considered when planning health interventions.",10.1310/sci2201-3,Eastern Michigan University,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

As part of chronic care, sharing patient-generated health data (PGHD) is likely to play a prominent role. Sharing PGHD is increasingly recognized as potentially useful for not only monitoring health conditions but for informing and supporting collaboration with caregivers and healthcare providers. In this paper, we describe a new design for the fine-grained control over sharing one's PGHD to support collaborative self-care, one that centers on giving people with health conditions control over their own data. The system, Data Checkers (DC), uses a grid-based interface and a preview feature to provide users with the ability to control data access and dissemination. DC is of particular use in the case of severe chronic conditions, such as spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D), that require not just intermittent involvement of healthcare providers but daily support and assistance from caregivers. In this paper, after providing relevant background information, we articulate our steps for developing this innovative system for sharing PGHD including (a) use of a co-design process; (b) identification of design requirements; and (c) creation of the DC System. We then present a qualitative evaluation of DC to show how DC satisfied these design requirements in a way that provided advantages for care. Our work extends existing research in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp), and Health Informatics about sharing data and PGHD.",10.3389/fcomp.2021.639748,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Methods: After baseline assessments, 27 participants were randomized using a 2:1 block design to either the experimental intervention or a usual care group. Thirteen of the 19 participants in the intervention group completed the program. Follow-up assessments were completed at 3 and 6 months after baseline. Results: Results suggest that the Health Mechanics intervention delivered in an in-person format was perceived as useful and relevant in addressing a diverse range of health issues with participants with a wide range of personal and impairment characteristics. However, attrition rates and barriers to recruitment suggested limitations in the acceptability of the format for this population. Conclusion: Additional research is needed to identify the populations that would most benefit from the program and the most efficacious context for administration.",10.1310/sci2202-121,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,
Michelle Meade,Disclosing disability in the employment setting: Perspectives from workers with multiple sclerosis,2017.0,Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation,Review,disclosure; Multiple sclerosis; disclosure; Multiple sclerosis,"2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Individuals must disclose their disability to their employer to benefit from work accommodations. Since individuals with multiple sclerosis often have ""invisible"" symptoms, they must decide whether or not to disclose their diagnosis to employers and whether the perceived benefits are worth the perceived risks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify factors that may influence the decision to disclose disability to an employer and the consequences of disclosure for participants with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Qualitative analysis was conducted using narratives from 8 focus groups held in three US states (South Carolina, Georgia and Ohio). All participants (N=74) were 18 years of age or older, spoke English, and had worked after MS diagnosis, although not all were employed at the time of the study. In focus groups sessions, participants were asked ""Did you decide to tell your employer about your MS? If so, how did it impact either finding or maintaining employment?"" RESULTS: Narrative responses indicated eight themes that fell into two categories: decision to disclose and consequences of disclosure. In the category of Decision to Disclose, themes included (1) disclosing to explain, prepare, or educate, (2) general disclosure, no concerns, (3) limiting, delaying, or deciding not to disclose, and (4) unsure about future disclosure. Within Consequences of Disclosure, themes included (5) positive and supportive reactions, (6) mixed or variable reaction in the same work environment, (7) no real reaction, positive or negative, and (8) leading to termination of employment. CONCLUSION: Our findings shed important light on the diversity of considerations and impact on employment of disclosing disability in the workplace for those with MS and highlight the importance of individuals' feeling that they have control over the process.",10.3233/JVR-170893,MUSC College of Health Professions,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Methods: Potential participants consisted of all individuals with traumatic SCI, ages 7 and older, who had received care through a large academic medical center in the Midwest between January 1, 2003, and January 2, 2013. All eligible individuals received the survey as part of a four-stage mailing that asked questions about electronic device use in addition to questions about demographic and injury-related characteristics. Results: Mailings were sent to 820 individuals; of those, 451 completed and returned the survey. Descriptive and nonparametric statistics were performed. Individuals with high-level tetraplegia were less likely to use tablet and handheld electronic devices than individuals at all other SCI levels. Individuals aged 65 years and older were less likely to own or use tablet computers and handheld devices than all other age groups. Conclusion: While electronic devices hold considerable potential as a treatment modality for individuals who have sustained SCI, there is diversity in the particular electronic devices that are used by such individuals due to injury-related characteristics and age.",10.1080/10790268.2016.1248525,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

The average US citizen can expect to live 20% of his or her life with a disability. Rehabilitation technologies play a major role in improving the quality of life for people with a disability, yet widespread and highly challenging needs remain. Within the US, a major effort aimed at the creation and evaluation of rehabilitation technology has been the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Centers (RERCs) sponsored by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research. As envisioned at their conception by a panel of the National Academy of Science in 1970, these centers were intended to take a ""total approach to rehabilitation"", combining medicine, engineering, and related science, to improve the quality of life of individuals with a disability. Here, we review the scope, achievements, and ongoing projects of an unbiased sample of 19 currently active or recently terminated RERCs. Specifically, for each center, we briefly explain the needs it targets, summarize key historical advances, identify emerging innovations, and consider future directions. Our assessment from this review is that the RERC program indeed involves a multidisciplinary approach, with 36 professional fields involved, although 70% of research and development staff are in engineering fields, 23% in clinical fields, and only 7% in basic science fields; significantly, 11% of the professional staff have a disability related to their research. We observe that the RERC program has substantially diversified the scope of its work since the 1970's, addressing more types of disabilities using more technologies, and, in particular, often now focusing on information technologies. RERC work also now often views users as integrated into an interdependent society through technologies that both people with and without disabilities co-use (such as the internet, wireless communication, and architecture). In addition, RERC research has evolved to view users as able at improving outcomes through learning, exercise, and plasticity (rather than being static), which can be optimally timed. We provide examples of rehabilitation technology innovation produced by the RERCs that illustrate this increasingly diversifying scope and evolving perspective. We conclude by discussing growth opportunities and possible future directions of the RERC program.",10.1186/s12984-017-0321-3,"University of California, Irvine",0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Methods: A qualitative approach used 6 focus groups at 2 sites with 44 participants who were at least 10 years post SCI. All had been employed at some point since injury. Heterogeneous and homogeneous groups were delineated based on specific characteristics, such as education, gender, or race. Group sessions followed a semi-structured interview format with questions about personal, environmental, and policy related factors influencing employment following SCI. All group sessions were recorded, transcribed, and coded into conceptual categories to identify topics, themes, and patterns. Inferences were drawn about their meaning. NVivo 10 software using the constant comparative method was used for data analysis. Results: Narratives discussed the relationship between employment and psychological and emotional health and health management. Four themes were identified: (1) adjustment and dealing with emotional reactions, (2) gaining self-confidence, (3) preventing burnout, and (4) attitudes and perspectives. Most themes reflected issues that varied based on severity of injury as well as stage of employment. Conclusions: Individuals with SCI who are successful in working following injury must determine how to perform the behaviors necessary to manage their health and prevent emotional or physical complications. The emotional consequences of SCI must be recognized and addressed and specific behaviors enacted in order to optimize employment outcomes.",10.1310/sci2202-111,MUSC College of Health Professions,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Michelle Meade,It's all of the above: Benefits of working for individuals with spinal cord injury,2015.0,Topics in Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation,Article,Spinal Cord; Work; employment; qualitative; spinal cord injuries,"2015 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.Background: The majority of research on employment among persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) focuses on the employment rate at a given point in time to the exclusion of quality employment outcomes. Objective: To identify the employment outcomes of greatest importance as defined by those with SCI who have worked since injury. Methods: A qualitative approach was used with 6 focus groups at 2 sites (Minnesota and Georgia). Participants (N = 44) were a minimum of 10 years after injury and had been employed at some point after SCI. We identified participants through a 40-year longitudinal study of SCI and a community resource. A combination of homogeneous (race/ethnic minority group, female group) and heterogeneous groups were convened. A semi-structured interview format queried participants about personal, environmental, and policy-related factors that impacted obtaining, maintaining, and advancing in employment. Results: Seven overlapping themes were identified under the 2 broad categories of compensation and subjective well-being: (1) salary and what it can support, (2) health insurance and other fringe benefits, (3) promotions and recognition, (4) social connection and support, (5) job satisfaction and enjoyment from working, (6) making a difference and helping others, and (7) psychological and emotional health. Conclusion: The results indicate several common themes among persons with SCI who have successful employment histories, suggesting that the benefits of employment are multifaceted and go beyond monetary compensation.",10.1310/sci2101-1,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,
Michelle Meade,Perceptions of quality of employment outcomes after multiple sclerosis: A qualitative study,2016.0,Journal of Rehabilitation,Article,Multiple Sclerosis; Perception,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify quality outcomes of employment, as defined by those with MS who worked at some point following their diagnosis. Research Methods: Qualitative approach using eight focus groups at three sites (Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina) with a total of 74 participants. Inclusion criteria: (1) >18 years, (2) < 65 at time of diagnosis, (3) physical disability from MS, and (4) must have been employed after diagnosis. The majority of participants were identified through MS advocacy organizations and support groups in the three states. Results: Narrative responses fell into 14 overlapping themes grouped under the 3 broad categories of (1) Compensation, (2) Personal Well-being, and (3) Benefitting Others. Compensation included three themes: Salary; Support responsibilities and lifestyle; and Pay for health needs, including medications. Personal Well-being encompassed eight themes: Maintain health and wellness; Stress and burden; Something to do and a reason to get up; Socialization and interacting with others; Sense of purpose and direction; Pride and sense of accomplishment; Identity; and Enjoyment. Three themes were within Benefitting Others: Value added and general helping others; Providing direct help or assistance; and Inspiring others. Conclusion: The importance of work to the lives of people with MS and other disabling conditions cannot be measured by employment rate alone. Results of this study provide some encouraging evidence that people with MS view work as an important social role and as a means of staying active and retaining one's identity.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,
Michelle Meade,Racial and Ethnic Inequities in Use of Preventive Services Among Privately Insured Adults With a Pediatric-Onset Disability,2022.0,Annals of Family Medicine,Article,Adult; cerebral palsy; disability; health care disparity; preventive; spina bifida; Adult,"2022, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc. All rights reserved.PURPOSE Cerebral palsy (CP) and spina bifida (SB) are pediatric-onset disabilities. Adults living with CP/SB are in a greater need of preventive care than the general population due to their increased risk for chronic diseases. Our objective was to compare White/Black and White/Hispanic inequities in the use of preventive services. METHODS Using 2007-2017 private claims data, we identified a total of 11,635 adults with CP/BS. Of these, 8,935 were White, 1,457 Black, and 1,243 Hispanic. We matched health-related variables (age, sex, comorbid conditions) between White adults and those in each minority subpopulation. Generalized estimating equations were used and all models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, income, education, and US Census divisions. Outcomes of interest were: (1) any office visit; (2) any physical/occupational therapy; (3) wellness visit; (4) bone density screening; (5) cholesterol screening; and (6) diabetes screening. RESULTS The rate of recommended services for all subpopulations of adults with CP/SB was low. Compared with White adults, Hispanic adults had lower odds of wellness visits (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.53-0.96) but higher odds of diabetes screening (OR = 1.48, 95% CI, 1.13-1.93). Compared with White adults, Black adults had lower odds of wellness visits (OR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.24-1.00) and bone density screening (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.31-0.95). CONCLUSIONS Preventive service use among adults with CP/SB was low. Large White-minority disparities in wellness visits were observed. Interventions to address physical accessibility, adoption of telehealth, and increased clinician education may mitigate these disparities, particularly if initiatives target minority populations.",10.1370/afm.2849,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55033905300.0,1856339.0

Methods: Qualitative analyses were conducted of the written comments that were completed as part of a cross-sectional survey of individuals with SCI living in the community. More than 1,800 mail surveys were distributed to individuals identified as having a traumatic SCI through the records and/or membership lists of 4 organizations. Four hundred and seventy-five individuals completed and returned the survey, with approximately half (48.6%; n = 231) of respondents answering the openended question ""Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your resilience or ability to 'bounce back' when you face a challenge?"" Results: Analyses of these responses identified both specific resources and cognitive perspectives that are associated with perceived happiness. Responses fell within 8 general categories: resilience, general outlook on life, social support and social relationships, religion or faith in a higher power, mood, physical health and functioning (including pain), social comparisons, and resources. Nuanced themes within these categories were identified and were generally concordant with self-reported level of happiness. Conclusion: A majority of respondents with SCI identified themselves as happy and explained their adjustment and resilience as related to personality, good social support, and a spiritual connection. In contrast, pain and physical challenges appeared to be associated with limited ability to bounce back.",10.1310/sci2202-99,Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: A Spinal Cord Injury Model System, with additional participants recruited from other sites. Participants: Subjects (N=291) who incurred traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) with resultant neurogenic bowel who were ≥5 years postinjury at the time of interview. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Constipation, bowel incontinence, and neurogenic bowel dysfunction questionnaire scores. These measures were all derived from the Bowel and Bladder Treatment Index. Data analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics as well as logistic and linear regression modeling. Results: Risk factors contributing to bowel incontinence included overall bowel dysfunction as measured by the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, timing of bowel program, being married or having a significant other, urinary incontinence, constipation, and use of diuretics. Constipation was best predicted by age, race/ethnicity, using laxatives/oral medications, incomplete tetraplegia, frequency of bowel movements, abdominal pain, access to clinicians and caregivers, and history of bowel surgeries. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction scores were predicted by neurologic classification; use of laxatives, oral medications, or both; bowel incontinence; and frequency of fiber intake. Conclusions: These results suggest a number of factors that should be considered when treating neurogenic bowel complications and dysfunction in persons with SCI.",10.1016/j.apmr.2016.03.019,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

However, limited research is available to support the many recommendations that are made. Objective: To describe the occurrence of behaviors associated with the management of neurogenic bowel and bladder among individuals with chronic SCI and to explore whether relationships exist between the performance of those behaviors and outcomes related to health and quality of life. Methods: A survey was developed based on clinical guidelines to collect self-report information about the performance of specific behaviors associated with the management of neurogenic bowel and bladder by individuals with SCI. It was administered to 246 individuals with chronic SCI living in the community as part of a larger ongoing study. Results: Results suggest that the methods that those with SCI use to manage neurogenic bowel and bladder are multifaceted. Many methods are performed with significant consistency, but significant variations exist for some and are often associated with neurological status, methods of evacuation, and quality of life. Conclusion: Many people with SCI of long duration are not sure of the sources of recommendations for some of the management activities that they or their personal care assistants conduct. It is prudent for clinicians working with these people to review their recommendations periodically to ensure that they are current and understood.",10.1310/sci2202-85,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7840-6364,35553228300.0,

Objective: To examine the relationship between employment and behaviors associated with the management of physical health and functioning as described by individuals with SCI who have been employed post injury. Methods: A qualitative approach using 6 focus groups at 2 sites included 44 participants with SCI who had worked at some time post injury.

Results: Within the area of behaviors and management of physical health and functioning, 4 overlapping themes were identifed: (1) relearning your own body and what it can do; (2) general health and wellness behaviors; (3) communication, education, and advocacy; and (4) secondary conditions and aging. Specifc themes articulate the many types of behaviors individuals must master and their impact on return to work as well as on fnding, maintaining, and deciding to leave employment. Conclusions: Individuals with SCI who are successfully employed after injury must learn how to perform necessary behaviors to manage health and function in a work environment.

Participants and Methods: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted from September 1, 2022 to February 2, 2023, among privately insured beneficiaries if they had an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision or 10th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code for TSCI (n=9081). Incidence estimates of serious and life-threatening morbidities, and more common secondary and long-term health conditions, were compared at 5 years of enrollment. Survival models were used to quantify unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for serious and life-threatening morbidities. Results: Adults living with TSCI and T2D had a higher incidence of all of the morbidities assessed as compared with nondiabetic adults with TSCI. Fully adjusted survival models reported that adults with TSCI and T2D had a greater hazard for most of the serious and life-threatening conditions assessed, including sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.65), myocardial infarction (HR: 1.63), osteomyelitis (HR: 1.9), and stroke or transient ischemic attack (HR: 1.59). Rates for comorbid and secondary conditions were higher for individuals with TSCI and T2D, such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, and depression, even after controlling for sociodemographic and comorbid conditions.

Objective To examine national trends in disparities in access to health care and to identify the impact of physical disability and the personal factors that are associated with unmet health care needs, defined as self-reported ability to get medical care, dental care or prescription medications, among working age adults within the United States. Methods Logistic regression analysis of a nationally representative sample of adults ages 25-64 (n = 163,220) with and without physical disabilities, using pooled data from the 2002-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Results Individuals with physical disabilities have 75% (p < 0.0001), 57% (p < 0.0001), and 85% (p < 0.000) higher odds of having unmet medical, dental, and prescription medication needs, respectively. Sociodemographic and health factors were related to unmet needs in all three measures of access to care. In particular, being female, living at or near the poverty level, and lacking health insurance increased the odds of unmet health care needs. Predicted probabilities of unmet health care needs from 2002 to 2011 show persistent gaps between individuals with and without physical disabilities, with a growing gap in unmet dental care (p = 0.004). Conclusion Having physical disabilities increase the odds of unmet health care needs. This study has important policy and community program implications. The Affordable Care Act could significantly reduce unmet health care needs, especially among individuals with physical disabilities.",10.1016/j.dhjo.2014.08.007,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,35553228300.0,
Michelle Meade,The intersection of disability and healthcare disparities: A conceptual framework,2015.0,Disability and Rehabilitation,Review,Access to care; Disability; Healthcare access; Healthcare disparities; Healthcare quality; Quality of care,"2014 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.Purpose: This article provides a conceptual framework for understanding healthcare disparities experienced by individuals with disabilities. While health disparities are the result of factors deeply rooted in culture, life style, socioeconomic status, and accessibility of resources, healthcare disparities are a subset of health disparities that reflect differences in access to and quality of healthcare and can be viewed as the inability of the healthcare system to adequately address the needs of specific population groups. Methods: This article uses a narrative method to identify and critique the main conceptual frameworks that have been used in analyzing disparities in healthcare access and quality, and evaluating those frameworks in the context of healthcare for individuals with disabilities. Specific models that are examined include the Aday and Anderson Model, the Grossman Utility Model, the Institute of Medicine (IOM)'s models of Access to Healthcare Services and Healthcare Disparities, and the Cultural Competency model. Results: While existing frameworks advance understandings of disparities in healthcare access and quality, they fall short when applied to individuals with disabilities. Specific deficits include a lack of attention to cultural and contextual factors (Aday and Andersen framework), unrealistic assumptions regarding equal access to resources (Grossman's utility model), lack of recognition or inclusion of concepts of structural accessibility (IOM model of Healthcare Disparities) and exclusive emphasis on supply side of the healthcare equation to improve healthcare disparities (Cultural Competency model). In response to identified gaps in the literature and short-comings of current conceptualizations, an integrated model of disability and healthcare disparities is put forth. Conclusion: We analyzed models of access to care and disparities in healthcare to be able to have an integrated and cohesive conceptual framework that could potentially address issues related to access to healthcare among individuals with disabilities. The Model of Healthcare Disparities and Disability (MHDD) provides a framework for conceptualizing how healthcare disparities impact disability and specifically, how a mismatch between personal and environmental factors may result in reduced healthcare access and quality, which in turn may lead to reduced functioning, activity and participation among individuals with impairments and chronic health conditions. Researchers, health providers, policy makers and community advocate groups who are engaged in devising interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities would benefit from the discussions.Implications for RehabilitationEvaluates the main models of healthcare disparity and disability to create an integrated framework.Provides a comprehensive conceptual model of healthcare disparity that specifically targets issues related to individuals with disabilities.Conceptualizes how personal and environmental factors interact to produce disparities in access to healthcare and healthcare quality.Recognizes and targets modifiable factors to reduce disparities between and within individuals with disabilities.",10.3109/09638288.2014.938176,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,35553228300.0,

Data were extracted from the 2011 National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems database.Participantsg Patients with traumatic SCI (N= 5146; white, 3175; African American, 1396; Hispanic, 575) who received rehabilitation at one of the relevant SCI Model Systems.Interventions Not applicable.Main Outcome Measures Hospitalization, including rate of hospitalization, number of hospitalizations, and number of days hospitalized during the 12 months before the first-, fifth-, and tenth-year follow-up interviews for the SCI Model Systems.Results Significant differences were found in rates of hospitalization at 1 and 5 years postinjury, with participants from Hispanic backgrounds reporting lower rates than either whites or African Americans. At 10 years postinjury, no differences were noted in the rate of hospitalization between racial/ethnic groups; however, compared with whites (P=.011) and Hispanics (P=.051), African Americans with SCI had 13 and 16 more days of hospitalization, respectively. Compared with the first year postinjury, the rate of hospitalization declined over time among whites, African Americans, and Hispanics; however, for African Americans, the number of days hospitalized increased by 12 days (P=.036) at 10 years versus 5 years postinjury.Conclusions Racial/ethnic variation appears to exist in postinjury hospitalization for individuals with SCI, with Hispanics showing the lowest rates of hospitalization at 1 and 5 years postinjury and African Americans having a significantly higher number of days hospitalized at 10 years postinjury. Potential explanations for these variations are discussed, and recommendations are made for potential changes to policy and clinical care.",10.1016/j.apmr.2014.07.399,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,35553228300.0,

To determine the in vivo biodistribution for differently charged poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers in B16 melanoma and DU145 human prostate cancer mouse tumor model systems. Methods. Neutral (NSD) and positive surface charged (PSD) generation 5 (d = 5 nm) PAMAM dendrimers were synthesized by using 3H-labeled acetic anhydride and tested in vivo. Dendrimer derivatives were injected intravenously, and their biodistribution was determined via liquid scintillation counting of tritium in tissue and excretory samples. Mice were also monitored for acute toxicity. Results. Both PSD and NSD localized to major organs and tumor. Dendrimers cleared rapidly from blood, with deposition peaking at 1 h for most organs and stabilizing from 24 h to 7 days postinjection. Maximal excretion occurred via urine within 24 h postinjection. Neither dendrimer showed acute toxicity. Conclusions. Changes in the net surface charge of polycationic PAMAMs modify their biodistribution. PSD deposition into tissues is higher than NSD, although the biodistribution trend is similar. Highest levels were found in lungs, liver, and kidney, followed by those in tumor, heart, pancreas, and spleen, while lowest levels were found in brain.

We examined the health implications of an immigration raid that resulted in multiple arrests and deportations and occurred midway through a community survey of a Latino population. We used linear regression following principal axis factoring to examine the influence of raid timing on immigration enforcement stress and self-rated health. We controlled for age, sex, relationship status, years in the county in which the raid occurred, children in the home, and nativity. 325 participants completed the survey before the raid and 151 after. Completing the survey after the raid was associated with higher levels of immigration enforcement stress and lower self-rated health scores. Findings indicate the negative impact of immigration raids on Latino communities.

Mikel Llanes,Significant effect of size on the in vivo biodistribution of gold composite nanodevices in mouse tumor models,2007.0,"Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine",Article,Composite nanodevice; Melanoma; Nanocomposite; PAMAM dendrimer; Tumor biodistribution; Composite nanodevice; Melanoma; Nanocomposite; PAMAM dendrimer; Tumor biodistribution,"There is growing interest in developing tissue-specific multifunctional drug delivery systems with the ability to diagnose or treat several diseases. One class of such agents, composite nanodevices (CNDs), is multifunctional nanomaterials with several potential medical uses, including cancer imaging and therapy. Nanosized metal-dendrimer CNDs consist of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (in various sizes, surface substituents, and net charges) and inorganic nanoparticles, properties of both of which can be individually modified and optimized. In this study we examine effects of size and surface charge on the behavior of Au-dendrimer CNDs in mouse tumor models. Quantitative biodistribution and excretion analyses including 5-nm and 22-nm positive surface, 5-nm and 11-nm negative surface, and a 5-nm neutral surface CNDs were carried out in the B16 mouse melanoma tumor model system. Results seen with the 22-nm CND in the B16 melanoma model were corroborated in a prostate cancer mouse tumor model system. Quantitative in vivo studies confirm the importance of charge and show for the first time the importance of size in affecting CND biodistribution and excretion. Interestingly, CNDs of different size and/or surface charge had high levels of uptake (""selective targeting"") to certain organs without specific targeting moieties placed on their surfaces. We conclude that size and charge greatly affect biodistribution of CNDs. These findings have significance for the design of all particle-based nanodevices for medical uses. The observed organ selectivity may make these nanodevices exciting for several targeted medical applications. © 2007.",10.1016/j.nano.2007.09.001,Roswell Park Cancer Institute,0000-0002-1699-5079,8077184300.0,

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Prior research has shown that immigration law enforcement contributes to poor health outcomes—including reproductive health outcomes—among Latinos. Yet no prior research has examined how immigration enforcement might inhibit reproductive justice and limit individual’s reproductive autonomy. We utilized data from an existing study that consisted of a partnership with a Latino community in Michigan in which an immigration raid resulted in multiple arrests and deportations midway through data collection. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 192) where no one was re-interviewed, we used ordinal logistic regression to compare desired pregnancy timing of individuals surveyed prior to and after the raid to determine the impact of an immigration raid on desired timing of next pregnancy. We then used qualitative data—including 21 in-depth interviews and participant observation—collected in the community after the raid to contextualize our findings. Controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, we found that Latinos surveyed in the aftermath of the raid were more likely to report a greater desire to delay childbearing than Latinos surveyed before the raid occurred. Our qualitative data showed that an immigration raid has financial and psychological effects on immigrant families and that a raid may impact reproductive autonomy because people are fearful of these impacts. These finding suggest that current immigration enforcement efforts may influence reproductive decision-making, impede Latinos reproductive autonomy, and that family-friendly immigration policy reform is needed.",10.1371/journal.pone.0217898,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-1699-5079,8077184300.0,
Mikel Llanes,Perspectives about and approaches to weight gain in pregnancy: A qualitative study of physicians and nurse midwives,2013.0,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,Article,Certified nurse midwives; Family physician; Gestational weight gain; Obesity; Obstetrics; Prenatal care; Qualitative study,"Background: Over one third of reproductive age women in the US are obese. Pregnancy is a strong risk factor for obesity, with excess weight gain as the greatest predictor of long term obesity. The majority of pregnant women gain more weight than recommended by the Institute of Medicine guidelines. The objective of this study was to understand prenatal care providers' perspectives on weight gain during pregnancy.Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews of 10 prenatal care providers (three family physicians, three obstetricians, and four nurse midwives) at a University Hospital in the Midwest, that included the ranking of important prenatal issues, and open-ended questions addressing: 1) general perceptions; 2) approach with patients; and 3) clinical care challenges.Results: Providers felt that appropriate weight gain during pregnancy was not a high priority. Many providers waited until patients had gained excess weight before addressing the issue, were not familiar with established guidelines, and lacked resources for patients. Providers also believed that their counseling had low impact on patients, avoided counseling due to sensitivity of the topic, and believed that patients were more influenced by other factors, such as their family, habits, and culture.Conclusions: Both providers and patients may benefit from increased awareness of the morbidity of excess weight gain during pregnancy. Practice-level policies that support the monitoring and management of weight gain during pregnancy could also improve care. Research that further investigates the barriers to appropriate weight gain is warranted. © 2013 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2393-13-47,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,8077184300.0,

Treatment options for acute paronychias include warm-water soaks, oral antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. In cases of chronic paronychia, it is important that the patient avoid possible irritants. Treatment options include the use of topical antifungal agents and steroids, and surgical intervention.

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + . Conclusions: Primary HPV screening with self-collection is equivalent to speculum-based collection among people aged 30–65. The findings emphasize the utility of self-collection in identifying high-grade lesions and the consistency of HPV detection across different collection methods.",10.1016/j.pmedr.2025.102971,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-7343-9132,7004474209.0,

All rights reserved.Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 30 million Americans. Early management focused on blood pressure (BP) control decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Less than 40% of patients with CKD achieve recommended BP targets due to many barriers. These barriers include a lack of understanding of the implications of their diagnosis and how to optimise their health. This cluster randomised control trial hypothesises that the combination of early primary care CKD education, and motivational interviewing (MI)-based health coach support, will improve patient behaviours aligned with BP control by increasing patient knowledge, self-efficacy and motivation. The results will aid in sustainable interventions for future patient-centric education and coaching support to improve quality and outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5. Outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5 receiving the intervention will be compared with similar patients within a control group. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) and systems methodologies will be used to optimise resource neutrality and leverage existing technology to support implementation and future dissemination. The innovative approach of this research focuses on the importance of a multidisciplinary team, including off-site patient coaching, that can intervene early in the CKD care continuum by supporting patients with education and coaching. Methods and analysis We will test impact of BP control when clinician-delivered education is followed by 12 months of MI-based health coaching. We will compare outcomes in 350 patients with CKD stages 3-5 between intervention and control groups in primary care. CQI and systems methodologies will optimise education and coaching for future implementation and dissemination.

All rights reserved.Background: The initiation and timely completion of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in young women is critical. We compared the initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among women in 2 community-based networks with electronic health records: 1 with a prompt and reminder system (prompted cohort) and 1 without (unprompted cohort). Methods: Female patients aged 9 to 26 years seen between March 1, 2007, and January 25, 2010, were used as the retrospective cohort. Patient demographics and vaccination dates were extracted from the electronic health records. Results: Patients eligible for the vaccine included 6019 from the prompted cohort and 9096 from the unprompted cohort. Mean age at initiation was 17.3 years in the prompted cohort and 18.1 years in the unprompted cohort. Significantly more (P <.001) patients initiated the vaccine in the prompted cohort (34.9%) compared with the unprompted cohort (21.5%). African Americans aged 9 to 18 years with ≥3 visits during the observation period were significantly more likely to initiate in the prompted cohort (P <.001). The prompted cohort was significantly more likely (P <.001) to complete the vaccine series in a timely manner compared with the unprompted cohort. Conclusion: More patients aged 9 to 26 years initiated and achieved timely completion of the HPV vaccine series in clinics using an electronic health record system with prompts compared with clinics without prompts.",10.3122/jabfm.2015.03.140082,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-7343-9132,7004474209.0,

They produce pain locally and in a referred pattern and often accompany chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Acute trauma or repetitive microtrauma may lead to the development of stress on muscle fibers and the formation of trigger points. Patients may have regional, persistent pain resulting in a decreased range of motion in the affected muscles. These include muscles used to maintain body posture, such as those in the neck, shoulders, and pelvic girdle. Trigger points may also manifest as tension headache, tinnitus, temporomandibular joint pain, decreased range of motion in the legs, and low back pain. Palpation of a hypersensitive bundle or nodule of muscle fiber of harder than normal consistency is the physical finding typically associated with a trigger point. Palpation of the trigger point will elicit pain directly over the affected area and/or cause radiation of pain toward a zone of reference and a local twitch response. Various modalities, such as the Spray and Stretch technique, ultrasonography, manipulative therapy and injection, are used to inactivate trigger points. Trigger-point injection has been shown to be one of the most effective treatment modalities to inactivate trigger points and provide prompt relief of symptoms.

METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 5,000 randomly selected active members of the American Academy of Family Physicians. RESULTS: There were 3,551 survey responses (71% response rate) and 2,748 useable questionnaires. Most respondents (75.4%) reported routinely using a chaperone in the room during the collection of a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. Significantly (P < .00001) more male physicians (84.1%) than female physicians (31.4%) reported using a chaperone. Physicians reporting routine use of a chaperone were significantly younger (P = .01) and did fewer Pap smears per month (P < .00001). Regional reporting of chaperone use varied significantly (P < .00001), with 71.6% reporting use in the Northeast, 89.0% in the South, 65.7% in the Midwest, and 72.4% in the West. CONCLUSION: Family physicians vary considerably in the reported use of a chaperone during the collection of a Pap smear.

Synergy, the concept of accomplishing more together than separately, is central to partnership effectiveness. However, synergy specific to long-standing, equity-focused CBPR partnerships has not been closely examined. To address this, we defined and developed measures of partnership synergy as one dimension of a participatory mixed methods study, Measurement Approaches to Partnership Success (MAPS), to develop a validated instrument to measure success in long-standing CBPR partnerships. Framed by a conceptual model and scoping literature review, we conducted in-depth interviews with a national panel of academic and community experts in CBPR and equity to develop partnership synergy measures. Items were refined through an iterative process, including a three-stage Delphi process, comparison with existing measures, cognitive interviews, and pilot testing. Seven questionnaire items were developed to measure synergy arising from equitable partnerships bringing together diverse partners across power differences to promote equity. Defining and measuring synergy in the context of long-standing partnership success is central to understanding the role of synergy in collaborative approaches to research and action and can strengthen CBPR partnerships to promote healthy communities and advance health equity.",10.1002/ajcp.12447,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Although scholars have advocated for decolonization of public health systems, the principles and processes of decolonization have not been explicitly elaborated nor applied broadly within the field. To map these concepts, we conducted a scoping review of decolonization of the Indigenous-focused health behavior and education literature. Following the JBI (formerly Joanna Briggs Institute) scoping review framework, we conducted searches in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science using key search terms: “health education,” “health behavior,” “health promotion,” “health practice” AND “decolonization” or “decolonial.” We also conducted targeted searches of key journals to ensure review completeness. For selected articles, we examined the article content, focal population, country context and health condition(s). We assessed for the definition of decolonization (if provided), descriptions of decolonial processes used (if stated), and the application of the decolonial processes (e.g., for research, intervention, or critique, etc.). Characteristics of decolonial processes were grouped by those that were similarly described leading to the generation of common themes of reflection, action, and planning. Our review suggests that no clear norms exist in conceptualizing the definitions and processes of decolonization in the reviewed literature. A small proportion of the articles articulate decolonial processes in manners that are consistent, cohesive and attentive to the goals of decolonization. We believe that this review will encourage public health practitioners to consider meaningful approaches to challenging colonizing structures and engage with community partners to advance the visions of social justice and health equity.",10.1177/10901981211010095,Emory University,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,51199344.0
Paul Chandanabhumma,Association between care fragmentation and total spending after durable left ventricular device implant: A mediation analysis of health care–associated infections within a national Medicare-Society of Thoracic surgeons INTERMACS linked dataset,2022.0,Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes,Article,Infection; Association; Ink; Medicare; Dataset; Delivery of health care; Health expenditures; Heart-assist devices; Infections; Integrated; Mediation analysis; Social network analysis,"2022 American Heart Association, Inc.BACKGROUND: Care fragmentation is associated with higher rates of infection after durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant. Less is known about the relationship between care fragmentation and total spending, and whether this relationship is mediated by infections. METHODS: Total payments were captured from admission to 180 days post-discharge. Drawing on network theory, a measure of care fragmentation was developed based on the number of shared patients among providers (ie, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, critical care specialists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) caring for 4,987 Medicare beneficiaries undergoing LVAD implantation between July 2009 - April 2017. Care fragmentation was measured using average path length, which describes how efficiently information flows among network members; longer path length indicates greater fragmentation. Terciles based on the level of care fragmentation and multivariable regression were used to analyze the relationship between care fragmentation and LVAD payments and mediation analysis was used to evaluate the role of post-implant infections. RESULTS: The patient cohort was 81% male, 73% white, 11% Intermacs Profile 1 with mean (SD) age of 63.1 years (11.1). The mean (SD) level of care fragmentation in provider networks was 1.7 (0.2) and mean (SD) payment from admission to 180 days post-discharge was $246,905 ($109,872). Mean (SD) total payments at the lower, middle, and upper terciles of care fragmentation were $250,135 ($111,924), $243,288 ($109,376), and $247,290 ($108,241), respectively. In mediation analysis, the indirect effect of care fragmentation on total payments, through infections, was positive and statistically significant (β=16032.5, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Greater care fragmentation in the delivery of care surrounding durable LVAD implantation is associated with a higher incidence of infections, and consequently, higher payments for Medicare beneficiaries. Interventions to reduce care fragmentation may reduce the incidence of infections and in turn enhance the value of care for patients undergoing durable LVAD implantation.",10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.121.008592,Darden School of Business,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

All rights reserved.OBJECTIVES: To examine whether fragmentation of care is associated with worse in-hospital and 90-day outcomes following durable ventricular assist device (VAD) implant. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: This study was conducted using Medicare claims linked to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (Intermacs) among patients undergoing VAD implant between July 2009 and April 2017. Medicare data were used to measure fragmentation of the multidisciplinary care delivery network for the treating hospital, based on providers' history of shared patients within the previous year. STS Intermacs data were used for risk adjustment and outcomes ascertainment. Hospitals were sorted into terciles based on the degree of network fragmentation, measured as the mean number of links separating providers in the network. Multivariable regression was used to associate network fragmentation with 90-day death or infection risk. RESULTS: The cohort included 5159 patients who underwent VAD implant, with 11.2% dying and 27.6% experiencing an infection within 90 days after implant. After adjustment, a 1-unit increase in network fragmentation was associated with an increase of 0.179 in the probability of in-hospital infection and an increase of 0.183 in the probability of 90-day infection (both P < .05). Similar results were observed in models of the numbers of in-hospital and 90-day infections. Network fragmentation was predictive of the probability of 90-day mortality, although this relationship was not significant after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Care delivery network fragmentation is associated with higher in-hospital and 90-day infection rates following durable VAD implant. These networks may serve as novel targets for enhancing outcomes for patients undergoing VAD implant.",10.37765/ajmc.2022.89280,Carlson School of Management,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

American Journal of Community Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Society for Community Research and Action.Public health has endorsed the use of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address health inequities involving diverse and marginalized communities. However, few studies have examined how group diversity among members of CBPR partnerships influenced how well the partnerships achieve their goals of addressing health inequities through equitable collaboration. We conducted secondary, convergent, mixed methods analysis to (1) evaluate the association between group diversity and participatory decision-making within CBPR partnerships, and (2) identify the perceived characteristics, benefits, and challenges of group diversity within CBPR partnerships. Using data from a cross-site study of federally funded CBPR partnerships, we analyzed and integrated data from surveys of 163 partnerships (n = 448 partners) and seven in-depth case study interviews (n = 55 partners). Quantitatively, none of the measured characteristics of group diversity was associated with participatory decision-making within the partnerships. Qualitatively, we found that partnerships mainly benefited from membership differences in functional characteristics (e.g., skillset) but faced challenges from membership differences in sociocultural characteristics (e.g., gender and race). The integrated findings suggest the need to further understand how emergent group characteristics and how practices that engage in group diversity contribute to collective functioning of the partnerships. Attention to this area can help promote health equity achievements of CBPR partnerships.",10.1002/ajcp.12626,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

All rights reserved.The care delivered to patients with cardiovascular disease involves coordination among a multitude of clinical team members spanning diverse inpatient and outpatient settings. The majority of quality improvement interventions in cardiovascular care have been developed based on quantitative evidence, which neither fully accounts for multilevel determinants (eg, patient, clinician, and institution) nor contextualization from key informants. The rigor and effectiveness of these interventions would be enhanced by mixed-methods studies whose strengths include (1) the use of qualitative research methodologies (eg, eliciting patient or clinician perspectives on barriers and facilitators of best practices) and (2) integrating qualitative and quantitative data and analyses to understand more fully effective strategies for achieving optimal care and outcomes for these patients across diverse settings. This article illustrates the application of a complex mixed-methods design to advance an evidence-based, customizable infection prevention toolkit for durable left ventricular assist device therapy.

Paul Chandanabhumma,Frontline Providers' and Patients' Perspectives on Improving Diagnostic Safety in the Emergency Department: A Qualitative Study,2024.0,The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety,Article,Art; Safety,"2024 The Joint CommissionBackground: Few studies have described the insights of frontline health care providers and patients on how the diagnostic process can be improved in the emergency department (ED), a setting at high risk for diagnostic errors. The authors aimed to identify the perspectives of providers and patients on the diagnostic process and identify potential interventions to improve diagnostic safety. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 ED physicians, 15 ED nurses, and 9 patients/caregivers at two separate health systems. Interview questions were guided by the ED–Adapted National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Diagnostic Process Framework and explored participant perspectives on the ED diagnostic process, identified vulnerabilities, and solicited interventions to improve diagnostic safety. The authors performed qualitative thematic analysis on transcribed interviews. Results: The research team categorized vulnerabilities in the diagnostic process and intervention opportunities based on the ED–Adapted Framework into five domains: (1) team dynamics and communication (for example, suboptimal communication between referring physicians and the ED team); (2) information gathering related to patient presentation (for example, obtaining the history from the patients or their caregivers; (3) ED organization, system, and processes (for example, staff schedules and handoffs); (4) patient education and self-management (for example, patient education at discharge from the ED); and (5) electronic health record and patient portal use (for example, automatic release of test results into the patient portal). The authors identified 33 potential interventions, of which 17 were provider focused and 16 were patient focused. Conclusion: Frontline providers and patients identified several vulnerabilities and potential interventions to improve ED diagnostic safety. Refining, implementing, and evaluating the efficacy of these interventions are required.",10.1016/j.jcjq.2024.03.003,,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,
Paul Chandanabhumma,Incidence of Newborn Drug Testing and Variations by Birthing Parent Race and Ethnicity before and after Recreational Cannabis Legalization,2023.0,JAMA Network Open,Article,Leg; Cannabis; Tin; Recreation,"2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.Importance: Thirty-seven US states and the District of Columbia mandate reporting newborns with suspected prenatal substance exposure to the state, and punitive policies that link prenatal substance exposure to newborn drug testing (NDT) may lead to disproportionate reporting of Black parents to Child Protective Services. The impact of recreational cannabis legalization on racial disproportionality in NDT is unknown. Objectives: To examine variations in the incidence and results of NDT by birthing parent race and ethnicity, variables associated with variation, and changes after statewide legalization of recreational cannabis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2014 to 2020 with 26366 live births to 21648 birthing people who received prenatal care at an academic medical center in the Midwestern United States. Data were analyzed from June 2021 to August 2022. Exposures: Variables included birthing parent age, race, ethnicity, marital status, zip code, insurance type, prenatal and newborn diagnoses codes, and prenatal urine drug test orders and results. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome was an NDT order. Secondary outcomes were substances detected. Results: Among 26366 newborns of 21648 birthing people (mean [SD] age at delivery, 30.5 [5.2] years), most birthing parents were White (15338 [71.6%]), were non-Hispanic (20125 [93.1%]), and had private insurance coverage (16159 [74.8%]). The incidence of NDT ordering was 4.7% overall (1237 newborns). Clinicians ordered more NDTs for Black compared with White newborns (207 of 2870 [7.3%] vs 335 of 17564 [1.9%]; P <.001) when the birthing parent had no prenatal urine drug test, a presumably low-risk group. Overall, 471 of 1090 NDTs (43.3%) were positive for only tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). NDTs were more likely to be positive for opioids in White compared with Black newborns (153 of 693 [22.2%] vs 29 of 308 [9.4%]; P <.001) and more likely to be positive for THC in Black compared with White newborns (207 of 308 [67.2%] vs 359 of 693 [51.8%]; P <.001). Differences remained consistent after state recreational cannabis legalization in 2018. Newborn drug tests were more likely to be positive for THC after legalization vs before legalization (248 of 360 [68.9%] vs 366 of 728 [50.3%]; P <.001) with no significant interaction with race and ethnicity groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, clinicians ordered NDTs more frequently for Black newborns when no drug testing was done during pregnancy. These findings call for further exploration of how structural and institutional racism contribute to disproportionate testing and subsequent Child Protective Services investigation, surveillance, and criminalization of Black parents.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.2058,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

However, half of pre-implant HRQOL data are incomplete in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ Intermacs registry. Pre-implant HRQOL incompleteness may reflect patient status or hospital resources to capture HRQOL data. We hypothesized that pre-implant HRQOL incompleteness predicts 90 day outcomes and serves as a novel quality metric. Methods: Risk factors for pre-implant HRQOL (EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale; 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire “KCCQ”) incompleteness were examined by stepwise logistic modeling. Direct standardization method was used to calculate adjusted incompleteness rates using a mixed effects logistic model. Hospitals were dichotomized as low or high based on median adjusted incompleteness rates. Andersen-Gill models were used to associate pre-implant HRQOL adjusted incompleteness rate with adverse events within 90 day post-implant. Results: The study cohort included 14,063 patients receiving a primary LVAD (4/2012-8/2017). HRQOL incompleteness at high-rate hospitals was more often due to administrative reasons (risk difference, EQ-5D: 10.1%; KCCQ-12: 11.6%) and less likely due to patient reasons (risk difference, EQ-5D: -8.9%; KCCQ-12: -11.4%). A 10% increase in the adjusted pre-implant EQ-5D incompleteness rate was significantly associated with higher risk of infection-related mortality (HR: 1.09), infection (HR: 1.05), and renal dysfunction (HR: 1.03). A 10% increase in the adjusted pre-implant KCCQ-12 incompleteness rate was significantly associated with higher risk of infection (HR: 1.04). Conclusions: Hospital adjusted pre-implant HRQOL incompleteness was predictive of 90-day post-implant outcomes and may serve as a novel quality metric.",10.1016/j.healun.2022.07.001,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Infection following device implantation remains an important and frequent complication and adversely affects patient-reported HRQOL. Methods: Patients in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support receiving a primary LVAD between April 2012 to October 2016 were included. The primary exposure was one-year post-implant infection, characterized by: (1) any infection; (2) total number of infections and (3) type (LVAD-specific, LVAD-related, non-LVAD). The association between infection and the primary composite adverse outcome (defined as EuroQoL Visual Analog Scale< 65, too sick to complete the survey, or death at 1-year) was estimated using inverse probability weighting and Cox regression. Results: The study cohort included 11,618 patients from 161 medical centers with 4,768 (41.0%) patients developing an infection, and 2,282 (19.6%) patients having> 1 infection during the follow up period. The adjusted odds ratio for the primary composite adverse outcome was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.19–1.24, p < 0.001) for each additional infection. Each additional infection was associated with a 3.49% greater probability of the primary composite outcome and was associated with worse performance across multiple dimensions of HRQOL as assessed by the EQ-5D for patients who survived to 1 year. Conclusions: For patients undergoing LVAD implantation, each additional infection within the first post-implantation year was associated with an incremental negative effect on survival free of impaired HRQOL.",10.1016/j.healun.2023.05.006,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,
Paul Chandanabhumma,Mixed methods research: A primer for the vascular surgeon,2022.0,Seminars in Vascular Surgery,Review,Ear; Research,"2022 Elsevier Inc.Mixed methods research is an approach that intentionally integrates both quantitative and qualitative research methods to answer a research question. The hallmark of mixed methods research is a focus on designing studies that integrate both quantitative and qualitative data, yielding greater results than either method could yield on its own. There are a number of fundamental concepts that are essential to conducting mixed methods research. These include a methodological approach that employs one of the three core study designs, involvement of a multidisciplinary team that includes both methodological and subject matter experts, and meticulous planning to ensure that the data collected can ultimately be integrated to yield findings that answer the original research question to the investigators’ (and funders’) satisfaction. In this article, we will discuss mixed methods research designs, data sources typically used in mixed methods research, and common data analysis and integration strategies. We will also provide examples of mixed methods research projects that have been used in vascular surgery. The intent of this article was to provide an overview of the field of mixed methods research, enabling the reader to critically assess mixed methods research studies in the literature and consider how this methodology might benefit their own research endeavors.",10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2022.09.003,West Virginia University School of Medicine Morgantown,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Methods: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support patients receiving a primary left ventricular assist device from April 2012 to May 2017 were included. The primary exposure was defined 3 ways: any infection, timing of first infection (early: ≤90 days; intermediate: 91-180 days; late: >180 days), and type (ventricular assist device specific, ventricular assist device related, non–ventricular assist device). The association between first infection and all-cause mortality was estimated using Cox regression. Results: The cohort included 12,957 patients at 166 centers (destination therapy: 47.4%, bridge-to-transplant: 41.2%). First infections were most often non–ventricular assist device (54.2%). Rates of first infection were highest in the early interval (10.7/100 person-months). Patients with any infection had a significantly higher adjusted hazard of death (hazard ratio, 2.63; 2.46-2.86). First infection in the intermediate interval was associated with the largest increase in adjusted hazard of death (hazard ratio, 3.26; 2.82-3.78), followed by late (hazard ratio, 3.13; 2.77-3.53) and early intervals (hazard ratio, 2.37; 2.16-2.60). Ventricular assist device–related infections were associated with the largest increase in hazard of death (hazard ratio, 3.02; 2.69-3.40), followed by ventricular assist device specific (hazard ratio, 2.92; 2.57-3.32) and non–ventricular assist device (hazard ratio, 2.42; 2.20-2.65). Conclusions: Relative to those without infection, patients with any postimplantation infection had an increased risk of death. Ventricular assist device–related infections and infections occurring in the intermediate interval were associated with the largest increase in risk of death. After left ventricular assist device implantation, infection prevention strategies should target non–ventricular assist device infections in the first 90 days, then shift to surveillance/prevention of driveline infections after 90 days.",10.1016/j.jtcvs.2021.10.056,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Introduction People with HIV-1 (PWH) have worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared with the general population. Using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) may help reorient the focus of HIV care towards improving HRQoL. This study aims to develop, implement and evaluate the use of PROs in HIV care. Methods and analysis This is a Danish single-centre, multistage mixed-methods study consisting of four substudies (studies I-IV). Study I is a qualitative focus group interview study aiming to identify relevant PRO domains, and barriers and benefits to PRO use. Participants are 5-10 PWH and 5-10 HIV healthcare providers (HCPs). Data are thematically analysed. Results will guide the design of a PRO measure (PROM). Study II is a quantitative study aiming to assess PWH's willingness and ability to engage with PRO. All PWH are consecutively invited to complete the PROMs before their next consultations. Demographic data are collected at enrolment. Differences between PWH who do/do not complete the PROMs are assessed. Study III is a quantitative before-and-after study aiming to assess the impact of PRO use on HCP awareness. Participants are all who complete the PROMs in Study II. In contrast to study II, HCPs are notified of the PROM results. The number of problems documented by the HCP in patients' medical records during studies II and III are compared using χ 2 tests. Multiple regression models are used to identify factors associated with HCP awareness. Study IV is a qualitative study aiming to explore PWH and HCP experiences of using PROs. Participants are 15-20 PWH and 10-15 HCP. Data are collected from participant observation of PRO consultations and individual interviews. Data are analysed thematically. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. Participants will provide written consent prior to participation. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.",10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077303,Hvidovre Hospital,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Ongoing evaluation of partnerships’ level of achievement of these key functions, along with their fidelity to the guiding principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), is therefore essential to understand how they can achieve desired partnership outcomes. This article describes the validated Measurement Approaches to Partnership Success (MAPS) Questionnaire and the use of an accompanying Facilitation Guide in helping members of CBPR partnerships evaluate their partnership’s state of development and interpret findings to improve its structure, processes, and outcomes. We describe the conceptual framework guiding the development of the MAPS Questionnaire and its 81-item across seven key outcome dimensions, along with 28 items measuring precursor characteristics of CBPR partnership outcomes. The Facilitation Guide provides general guidelines for sharing, interpreting, and applying results within partnerships using a participatory process, definitions and items for each dimension, an example of presenting summary means, and dimension-specific reflective questions for discussion. We offer recommendations for practical uses of the MAPS Questionnaire and Facilitation Guide. Whether used as a comprehensive tool or by dimension, the MAPS Questionnaire is conceptually sound and empirically validated for evaluating how CBPR partnerships can achieve long-standing success. CBPR partnerships at any stage of development will find the MAPS Questionnaire and Facilitation Guide useful in measuring and interpreting indicators of partnership success, sharing results, and improving their ability to contribute to achieving health equity goals.",10.1177/15248399231206088,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

A better understanding of diagnostic processes is needed to mitigate errors. This paper describes a study protocol to map diagnostic processes in the ED as a foundation for developing future error mitigation strategies. Methods and analysis This study of an adult and a paediatric academic ED uses a prospective mixed methods case study design informed by an ED-specific diagnostic decision-making model (the modified ED-National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) model) and two cognitive theories (dual process theory and distributed cognition). Data sources include audio recordings of patient and care team interactions, electronic health record data, observer field notes and stakeholder interviews. Multiple qualitative analysis methods will be used to explore diagnostic processes in situ, including systems information flow, human-human and human-system interactions and contextual factors influencing cognition. The study has three parts. Part 1 involves prospective field observations of patients with undifferentiated symptoms at high risk for diagnostic error, where each patient is followed throughout the entire care delivery process. Part 2 involves observing individual care team providers over a 4-hour window to capture their diagnostic workflow, team coordination and communication across multiple patients. Part 3 uses interviews with key stakeholders to understand different perspectives on the diagnostic process, as well as perceived strengths and vulnerabilities, in order to enrich the ED-NASEM diagnostic model. Ethics and dissemination The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this study, HUM00156261. This foundational work will help identify strengths and vulnerabilities in diagnostic processes. Further, it will inform the future development and testing of patient, provider and systems-level interventions for mitigating error and improving patient safety in these and other EDs. The work will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations at national and international meetings.",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044194,UC San Diego School of Medicine,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Most measures to date focus on factors that contribute to the development of new partnerships, and only a few have been adequately tested and validated. Methods. The Measurement Approaches to Partnership Success (MAPS) study followed a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and a multiphase process that included the construction and pilot testing of a questionnaire, and a national survey to validate the psychometric properties of the questionnaire in long-standing CBPR partnerships (existing ≥ six years). All members within partnerships were recruited to complete the survey (55 partnerships with 563 partners). We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), Cronbach’s alpha statistics, and a pairwise correlations approach to assess discriminant and convergent validity, and assessed internal consistency, and test–retest reliability. Results. All MAPS Questionnaire dimensions demonstrated strong validity and reliability and demonstrated agreement over time. Conclusion. The MAPS Questionnaire includes seven dimensions and 81 items related to the MAPS conceptual model and provides a scientific, in-depth measurement tool that allows long-standing CBPR partnerships to evaluate their work toward achieving health equity.",10.1177/10901981231213352,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Black birthing parents and their newborns disproportionately experience newborn drug testing for prenatal substance exposure by health care professionals (HCPs), which contributes to Child Protective Services (CPS) reporting, family separation, and termination of parental rights. This qualitative study aims to interrogate dominant power structures by exploring knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of HCPs and CPS professionals regarding the influence of structural racism on inequities in newborn drug testing practices. METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with 30 physicians, midwives, nurses, social workers, and CPS professionals guided by an explanatory framework, and conducted inductive, reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS We identified 3 primary themes: (1) levels of racism beyond the hospital structure contributed to higher rates of drug testing for Black newborns; (2) inconsistent hospital policies led to racialized application of state law and downstream CPS reporting; and (3) health care professionals knowledge of the benefits and disproportionate harms of CPS reporting on Black families influenced their decision making. CONCLUSION Health care professionals recognized structural racism as a driver of disproportionate newborn drug testing. Lack of knowledge and skill limitations of HCPs were barriers to dismantling power structures, thus impeding systems-level change. Institutional changes should shift focus from biologic testing and reporting to supporting the mutual needs of birthing parent and child through family-centered substance use treatment. State and federal policy changes are needed to ensure health equity for Black families and eliminate reporting to CPS for prenatal substance exposure when no concern for child abuse and neglect exists.",10.1370/afm.3139,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-9195-0869,57203727675.0,

The authors aimed to identify the perspectives of providers and patients on the diagnostic process and identify potential interventions to improve diagnostic safety. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 ED physicians, 15 ED nurses, and 9 patients/caregivers at two separate health systems. Interview questions were guided by the ED–Adapted National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Diagnostic Process Framework and explored participant perspectives on the ED diagnostic process, identified vulnerabilities, and solicited interventions to improve diagnostic safety. The authors performed qualitative thematic analysis on transcribed interviews. Results: The research team categorized vulnerabilities in the diagnostic process and intervention opportunities based on the ED–Adapted Framework into five domains: (1) team dynamics and communication (for example, suboptimal communication between referring physicians and the ED team); (2) information gathering related to patient presentation (for example, obtaining the history from the patients or their caregivers; (3) ED organization, system, and processes (for example, staff schedules and handoffs); (4) patient education and self-management (for example, patient education at discharge from the ED); and (5) electronic health record and patient portal use (for example, automatic release of test results into the patient portal). The authors identified 33 potential interventions, of which 17 were provider focused and 16 were patient focused. Conclusion: Frontline providers and patients identified several vulnerabilities and potential interventions to improve ED diagnostic safety. Refining, implementing, and evaluating the efficacy of these interventions are required.",10.1016/j.jcjq.2024.03.003,,0000-0002-3079-5591,57203727675.0,

Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 Deaf and 10 hearing participants with high and low health literacy from three healthcare sites. We conducted thematic analysis of the transcripts to explore information navigation experiences, information sources and dissemination preferences. Results: We found thematic differences between Deaf and hearing participants with high and low health literacy in terms of information needs, information search experiences, information search perceptions, and preferred information dissemination approaches. Relative to hearing counterparts, Deaf participants were more likely to encounter challenges in accessing and understanding online information. Deaf participants with low health literacy were more likely to rely on visual graphics to support their understanding of the information than those with high health literacy. Deaf participants advocated for tailored approaches to disseminate health information to Deaf communities.

Our study defines the kappa agreement between self- and speculum-based collection techniques for 15 types of high-risk HPV. Additionally, we describe the sensitivity and specificity ratios for HPV testing using both collection methods. Methods: Participants recruited in 2020–2022 included 97 colposcopy attendees and 96 routine primary care screening attendees aged 30–65, who agreed to self-sample before their clinically scheduled speculum-based exam. Prevalence-based kappa calculated agreement, sensitivity and specificity ratios calculated accuracy using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) threshold. Results: The average ages were 45.9 (SD 10.5) and 46.2 (SD 11.0) years for the colposcopy and primary care attendees, respectively. HPV 16, 68, and 39 were the most common types detected. The lower bound of the 95 % Cl for kappa calculations was above 0.81, indicating almost perfect agreement across all HPV genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity ratios were consistent at 1.0 across both collection methods. The HPV positivity rate was significantly higher among colposcopy attendees at 66 % (64/97), compared to 14 % (13/96) among routine primary care screeners. The study identified 17 women with CIN2 + .

All rights reserved.Background: Individuals at increased risk for cancer are ascertained at low rates of 1% to 12% in primary care (PC). Underserved populations experience disparities of ascertainment, but data are lacking. INHERET is an online personal and family history tool to facilitate the identification of individuals who are eligible, according to guidelines, to be counseled on germline genetic testing and risk management. Patients and Methods: INHERET data entry uses cancer genetics clinic questionnaires and algorithms that process patient data through NCCNClinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology and best practice guidelines. The tool was tested in silico on simulated and retrospective patients and prospectively in a pilot implementation trial. Patients in cancer genetics and in PC clinics were invited to participate via email or a card. Informed consent was completed online. Results: INHERET aimed to integrate patient data by algorithms based on professional and best practice guidelines to elicit succinct, actionable recommendations that providers can use without affecting clinic workflow or encounter length. INHERET requires a 4th-grade reading level, has simple navigation, and produces data lists and pedigree graphs. Prospective implementation testing revealed understandability of 90% to 100%, ease of use of 85%, and completion rates of 85% to 100%. Physicians using INHERET reported no added time to their encounters when patients were identified for counseling. In a specialty genetics clinic, INHERET's data were input, on average, within 72 hours compared with 4 to 6 weeks through standard care, and the queue for scheduling patients decreased from 400 to fewer than 15 in,6 months. Conclusions: INHERET was found to be accessible for all education and age levels, except patients aged.70 years, who encountered more technical difficulties. INHERET aided providers in conveying high-risk status to patients and eliciting appropriate referrals, and, in a specialty clinic, it produced improved workflows and shortened queues.",10.6004/jnccn.2021.7072,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,

Despite many changes in the practice of medicine and legal, cultural, and technological advances that afford greater opportunities for people with disabilities, the profession's approach to TS largely has not changed over the ensuing four decades. Although physicians with disabilities bring unique perspectives to medicine and contribute to a diverse physician workforce of culturally competent practitioners, they remain underrepresented in the profession. As part of an initiative sponsored by the Association of Academic Physiatrists, the authors describe the need for an updated TS framework, outlining interval changes in the legal and regulatory climate, medical practice, and medical education since the initial TS guidelines were put forth. They conclude by offering eight recommendations and two functional approaches to TS that are consistent with now-prevalent competency-based medical education constructs. The profession's commitment to diversity and inclusion should extend explicitly to people with disabilities, and this stance should be clearly communicated through medical schools' TS and procedures for requesting accommodations. To this end, schools should consider the principles of universal design to create policies and assessments that work for all learners, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for after-the-fact accommodations. A thoughtful and concerted effort along these lines is long overdue in medical education.",10.1097/ACM.0000000000002517,Heersink School of Medicine,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the prevalence of published opinions about the use of professional academic writers to help disseminate the results of clinical research, particularly opinions about the use of ghost writers, very little information has been published on the possible roles for professional writers within academic medical departments or the mechanisms by which these departments can hire and compensate such writers. To begin addressing this lack of information, the Association of Departments of Family Medicine hosted an online discussion and a subsequent webinar in which we obtained input from three departments of family medicine in the United States regarding their use of academic writers. This discussion revealed three basic models by which academic writers have benefitted these departments: (1) grant writing support, (2) research and academic support for clinical faculty, and (3) departmental communication support. Drawing on specific examples from these institutions, the purpose of this paper is to describe the key support activities, advantages, disadvantages, and funding opportunities for each model for other departments to consider and adapt.",10.22454/FAMMED.2022.465116,University of Washington School of Medicine,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Individuals with hearing loss (HL) are at higher risk for hospitalizations, and may be for readmissions, compared with their hearing peers. The objective of this prospective study was to confirm retrospective studies suggesting that HL increases hospital readmissions, and, if confirmed, possible causes for it. Methods: A prospective cohort study of English-speaking patients >55 years old admitted to general medical and surgical floors at 2 large hospital systems in southeastern Michigan over a 2-year period was conducted. All patients underwent bedside audiometric testing. HL presence and severity were categorized using World Health Organization pure tone assessment parameters. Readmission rates, Charlson comorbidity index, socio-demographic and medical variables were obtained from Epic EMR databases. Outcomes: There were 1247 hospitalized patients enrolled. Of these, 76.8% had documented HL of which 50.5% (630) was mild HL and 26.3% (328) moderate or worse HL. Patients with any HL were older and more likely to be non-Hispanic, white, male, and had less education, lower health literacy, more comorbidities, and more difficulty communicating with their doctor. Readmission rates at 30 and 90-days were similar between HL and hearing groups, after adjusting for HL severity, Charlston index, and numerous potential confounders. Conclusion: Patients with HL do not seem to have higher rates of hospital readmissions. We did find high frequency of HL in hospitalized patients along with significant communication difficulties that patients had with their clinicians. These findings have implications for measures to improve patient-physician communication, potentially improving long-term health outcomes.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.220407R1,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-3483-5607,6701847250.0,4824740.0
Philip Zazove,Hearing Loss and Healthcare Access among Adults,2021.0,Seminars in Hearing,Article,healthcare access; hearing loss; medical expenditure panel survey,"2021 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.. All rights reserved.Hearing loss (HL) is common among individuals aged 50 and older and is associated with increased healthcare costs. Whether HL is associated with less access to healthcare is unclear. In this study, we examined the association between HL and access to medical care and prescription drugs among individuals 50+ with and without HL. We used nationally representative 2013-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, consisting of 1,977 adults with HL and 17,399 without. We applied an inverse propensity score weighting and regression modeling to adjust for any potential differences in health and socioeconomic conditions between the two groups. Adults with HL were more likely to be white, less educated, poorer, and with public insurance (p < 0.001). They were also likely to have hypertension, heart disease, stroke, emphysema, high cholesterol, diabetes, joint pain, and arthritis (p < 0.001). The odds of reporting unmet medical needs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29-2.66), delay in getting medical needs met (OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.00-1.87), and having unfilled prescriptions (OR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.27-2.59) were higher among individuals with HL compared with their counterparts without HL. Individuals with HL have less access to care and prescription drugs. To ensure equitability in access, public health policies should address specific needs of people with HL.",10.1055/s-0041-1726000,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,6701847250.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Hearing loss (HL) is underdiagnosed and often unaddressed. A recent study of screening for HL using an electronic prompt showed efficacy in increasing appropriate referrals for subsequent testing. We build on the results of this study using a qualitative lens to explore implementation processes through the perspectives of family medicine clinicians. METHODS We collected clinic observations and semistructured interviews of family medicine clinicians and residents who interacted with the HL prompt. All data were analyzed using thematic, framework, and mixed methods integration strategies. RESULTS We interviewed 27 clinicians and conducted 10 observations. Thematic analysis resulted in 6 themes: (1) the prompt was overwhelmingly viewed as easy, simple to use, accurate; (2) clinicians considered prompt as an effective way to increase awareness and conversations with patients about HL; (3) clinician and staff buy-in played a vital role in implementation; (4) clinicians prioritized prompt during annual visits; (5) medical assistant involvement in prompt workflow varied by health system, clinic, and clinician; (6) prompt resulted in more conversations about HL, but uncertain impact on patient outcomes. Themes are presented alongside constructs of normalization process theory and intervention outcomes. CONCLUSION Integration of a HL screening prompt into clinical practice varied by clinician buy-in and beliefs about the impact on patient outcomes, involvement of medical assistants, and prioritization during clinical visits. Further research is needed to understand how to leverage clinician and staff buy-in and whether implementation of a new clinical prompt has sustained impact on HL screening and patient outcomes.",10.1370/AFM.2695,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1789-7366,6701847250.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE Hearing loss, the second most common disability in the United States, is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Identifying it in early stages could prevent its known substantial adverse outcomes. METHODS A multiple baseline design was implemented to assess a screening paradigm for identifying and referring patients aged ≥55 years with hearing loss at 10 family medicine clinics in 2 health systems. Patients completed a consent form and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHI). An electronic alert prompted clinicians to screen for hearing loss during visits. RESULTS The 14,877 eligible patients during the study period had 36,701 encounters. Referral rates in the family medicine clinics increased from a baseline rate of 3.2% to 14.4% in 1 health system and from a baseline rate of 0.7% to 4.7% in the other. A general medicine comparison group showed referral rate increase from the 3.0% baseline rate to 3.3%. Of the 5,883 study patients who completed the HHI 25.2% (n = 1,484) had HHI scores suggestive of hearing loss; those patients had higher referral rates, 28% vs 9.2% (P <001). Of 1,660 patients referred for hearing testing, 717 had audiology data available for analysis: 669 (93.3%) were rated appropriately referred and 421 (58.7%) were considered hearing aid candi-dates. Overall, 71.5% of patients contacted felt their referral was appropriate. CONCLUSION An electronic alert used to remind clinicians to ask patients aged ≥55 years about hearing loss significantly increased audiology referrals for at-risk patients. Audiologic and audiogram data support the effectiveness of the prompt. Clinicians should consider adopting this method to identify patients with hearing loss to reduce its known and adverse sequelae.",10.1370/afm.2590,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1789-7366,6701847250.0,

All rights reserved.PURPOSE We undertook a study to examine national trends in potentially preventable hospitalizations—those for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions that could have been avoided if patients had timely access to primary care—across 3,200 counties and various subpopulations of older adults in the United States. METHODS We used 2010-2014 Medicare claims data to examine trends in potentially preventable hospitalizations among beneficiaries aged 65 years and older and developed heat maps to examine county-level variation. We used a generalized estimating equation and adjusted the model for demographics, comorbidities, dual eligibility (Medicare and Medicaid), ZIP code–level income, and county-level number of primary care physicians and hospitals. RESULTS Across the 3,200 study counties, potentially preventable hospitalizations decreased in 327 counties, increased in 123 counties, and did not change in the rest. At the population level, the adjusted rate of potentially preventable hospitalizations declined by 3.45 percentage points from 19.42% (95% CI, 18.4%-20.5%) in 2010 to 15.97% (95% CI, 15.3%-16.6%) in 2014; it declined by 2.93, 2.87, and 3.33 percentage points among White, Black, and Hispanic patients to 14.96% (95% CI, 14.67%-15.24%), 17.92% (95% CI, 17.27%-18.58%), and 17.10% (95% CI, 16.25%-18.0%), respectively. Similarly, the rate for dually eligible patients fell by 3.71 percentage points from 21.62% (95% CI, 20.5%-22.8%) in 2010 to 17.91% (95% CI, 17.2%-18.7%) in 2014. (P <.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS During 2010-2014, rates of potentially preventable hospitalization did not change in the majority of counties. At the population level, although the rate declined among all subpopulations, dually eligible patients and Black and Hispanic patients continued to have substantially higher rates compared with non–dually eligible and White patients, respectively.",10.1370/afm.2605,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,6701847250.0,

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America. All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: Hearing loss (HL) is common among older adults and is associated with significant psychosocial, cognitive, and physical sequelae. Hearing aids (HA) can help, but not all individuals with HL use them. This study examines how social determinants may impact HA use. Research Design and Methods: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study involving a secondary analysis of a nationally representative data set, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; n = 35,572). This was followed up with 1:1 qualitative interviews (n = 21) with community participants to clarify our findings. Both samples included individuals aged 55 and older with a self-reported HL, with or without HA. The main outcome measure was the proportion of participants with a self-reported HL who use HA. Results and Discussion: Analysis of HRS data indicated that younger, nonwhite, non-Hispanic, lower income, and less-educated individuals were significantly less likely to use HA than their referent groups (all p values <. 001). Area of residence (e.g., urban) were not significantly associated with HA use. Qualitative findings revealed barriers to HA included cost, stigma, vanity, and a general low priority placed on addressing HL by health care providers. Facilitators to obtaining and using HA included family/friend support, knowledge, and adequate insurance coverage for HA. Implications: Many socioeconomic factors hinder individuals' ability to obtain and use HA, but these obstacles appeared to be mitigated in part when insurance plans provided adequate HA coverage, or when their family/friends provided encouragement to use HA.",10.1093/geront/gny051,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5561-9885,6701847250.0,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: We used 2008 to 2016 national longitudinal claims data (based on office visit, inpatient, or outpatient healthcare encounters) from a large private payer. We used Kaplan-Meier curves to examine unadjusted disease-free survival and crude and adjusted Cox regression models to examine associations between HAs and time to diagnosis of three age-related/HL-associated conditions within 3 years of HL diagnosis. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, census divisions, and prior diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and diabetes. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included 114 862 adults, aged 66 years and older, diagnosed with HL. MEASUREMENT: Diagnosis of (1) AD or dementia; (2) depression or anxiety; and (3) injurious falls. INTERVENTION: Use of HAs. RESULTS: Large sex and racial/ethnic differences exist in HA use. Approximately 11.3% of women vs 13.3% of men used HAs (95% confidence interval [CI] difference = −0.024 to −0.016). Approximately 13.6% of whites (95% CI = 0.13-0.14) vs 9.8% of blacks (95% CI = 0.09-0.11) and 6.5% of Hispanics (95% CI = 0.06-0.07) used HAs. The risk-adjusted hazard ratios of being diagnosed with AD/dementia, anxiety/depression, and injurious falls within 3 years after HL diagnosis, for those who used HAs vs those who did not, were 0.82 (95% CI = 0.76-0.89), 0.89 (95% CI = 0.86-0.93), and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of HAs is associated with delayed diagnosis of AD, dementia, depression, anxiety, and injurious falls among older adults with HL. Although we have shown an association between use of HAs and reduced risk of physical and mental decline, randomized trials are needed to determine whether, and to what extent, the relationship is causal.

Little is known about the association between hearing loss and substance use disorders in the general population. The objective of this study was to assess substance use disorder prevalence among individuals with hearing loss, versus those without hearing loss, in a nationally representative sample of adults. Methods: Two years (2015 and 2016) of National Survey on Drug Use and Health (unweighted N=86,186) were combined to compare substance use disorders among adults with and without self-reported hearing loss. Statistical analysis included descriptive frequencies, chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regressions. Analyses were performed in 2018. Results: Hearing loss prevalence across all age groups was 5.2%. Among younger age groups, after adjusting for sociodemographics, hearing loss was independently associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing a substance use disorder (ages 18–34 years, AOR=1.34, 95% CI=1.10, 1.64 vs 35–49 years, AOR=1.87, 95% CI=1.39, 2.53). Hearing loss was also associated with a greater likelihood of a prescription opioid use disorder (AOR=2.85, 95% CI=1.86, 4.39) in the group aged 18–34 years and, for the group aged 35–49 years, hearing loss increased the likelihood of both an alcohol use disorder (AOR=1.87, 95% CI=1.39, 2.53) and a prescription opioid use disorder (AOR=1.99, 95% CI=1.01, 3.91). Conclusions: Hearing loss is independently associated with substance use disorders among those aged 49 years and younger; these associations are particularly pronounced for prescription opioid use disorders in the group aged 18–34 years.

All rights reserved.IMPORTANCE: Hearing loss (HL) is common among older adults and is associated with poorer health and impeded communication. Hearing AIDS (HAs), while helpful in addressing some of the outcomes of HL, are not covered by Medicare. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether HA use is associated with health care costs and utilization in older adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used nationally representative 2013-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to evaluate the use of HAs among 1336 adults aged 65 years or older with HL. An inverse propensity score weighting was applied to adjust for potential selection bias between older adults with and without HAs, all of whom reported having HL. The mean treatment outcomes of HA use onhealth care utilization and costs were estimated. EXPOSURES: Encounter with the US health care system. MAINOUTCOMES ANDMEASURES: (1) Total health care, Medicare, and out-of-pocket spending; (2) any emergency department (ED), inpatient, and office visit; and (3) number of ED visits, nights in hospital, and office visits. RESULTS: Of the 1336 individuals includedin the study, 574 (43.0%) were women; mean (SD) age was 77 (7) years. Adults without HAs (n = 734) were less educated, had lower income, and were more likely to be from minority subpopulations. The mean treatment outcomes of using HAs per participant were (1) higher total annual health care spending by $1125 (95% CI, $1114 to $1137) and higher out-of-pocket spending by $325 (95% CI, $322 to $326) but lower Medicare spending by $71 (95% CI, -$81 to -$62); (2) lower probability of any ED visit by 2 percentage points (PPs) (24% vs26%; 95% CI, -2% to -2%) and lower probability of any hospitalizationby 2 PPs (20% vs 22%; 95% CI, -3% to -1%) but higher probability of any office visit by 4 PPs (96% vs 92%; 95% CI, 4% to 4%); and (3) 1.40 more office visits (95% CI, 1.39 to 1.41) but 0.46 (5%) fewer number of hospital nights (95% CI, -0.47 to -0.44), with no association with the number of ED visits, if any (95% CI, 0.01 to 0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates the beneficial outcomes of use of HAs in reducing the probability of any ED visits and any hospitalizations and in reducing the number of nights in the hospital. Although use of HAs reduced total Medicare costs, it significantly increased total and out-of-pocket health care spending. This information may have implications for Medicare regarding covering HAs for patients with HL.",10.1001/jamaoto.2018.0273,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,6701847250.0,

Although LVADs have been shown to increase quality of life and survival, the associated treatment burdens and complications deserve careful consideration. The current study illustrates myriad clinical challenges that can arise during long-term mechanical support using an older adult case history. Current data on LVAD use in older adults is reviewed, and a discussion of relevant points to consider before LVAD implantation in older adults, including advance care planning, assessment of gait and cognition, and the potential for substantial caregiver burden, is undertaken. © 2012, The American Geriatrics Society.",10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03740.x,VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,

All rights reserved.This chapter discusses the history of advance directives (ADs) and Advance Care Planning (ACP) in the United States of America, the evidence base regarding the application of ADs and ACP in American healthcare, and the use of technology to facilitate ACP and AD in the US. Improvements in public health and biomedical technology during the latter half of the twentieth century substantially extended life expectancy in the US from 47 in 1900 to 79 by 2014. This accomplishment paired with the aging of America's largest generation (know fondly as the 'baby boomers'), is largely responsible for an exponential increase in expenditures related to healthcare over the last 20 years.",10.1093/oso/9780198802136.003.0020,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,

Methods: Retrospective review of patients seen by the Palliative Care Service at the University of Michigan Health System from January 2008 to May 2008. Results: Of 131 patients seen in consultation, 70 received antimicrobials. We identified 92 infections among these 70 patients; therapy for 54 (58.7%) was empiric. Empiric therapy was most commonly prescribed for respiratory infection and urinary tract infection. Piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) was the most frequently used agent, with 26 patients receiving P/T (37.1%); 22 of 26 received this agent empirically (84.6%, P = .005). Vancomycin was prescribed to 23 patients (32.9%). Sixteen patients (22.9%) died in hospital; another 31 were enrolled in hospice care. Conclusions: Our results suggest significant use of empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized patients near the end of life. We advocate for careful assessment of potential benefits and treatment burdens of antimicrobial therapy, especially when palliation is the goal. © The Author(s) 2010.",10.1177/1049909109352336,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,
Phillip Eugene Rodgers,Association of Advance Care Planning Visits with Intensity of Health Care for Medicare Beneficiaries with Serious Illness at the End of Life,2021.0,JAMA Health Forum,Article,"care medicare, advance care, medicare beneficiaries, hospice use, hospice measure, beneficiaries illness, late hospice, care planning","2021 Authors. All rights reserved.Importance: Advance care planning (ACP) is intended to maximize the concordance of preferences with end-of-life (EOL) care and is assumed to lead to less intensive use of health care services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began reimbursing clinicians for ACP discussions with patients in 2016. Objective: To determine whether billed ACP visits are associated with intensive use of health care services at EOL. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective patient-level cohort analysis of seriously ill patients included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who met criteria for serious illness from January 1 to December 31, 2016, and died from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018. Analyses were completed from November 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five measures of EOL health care services used (inpatient admission, emergency department visit, and/or intensive care unit stay within 30 days of death; in-hospital death; and timing of first hospice bill) and a measure of EOL expenditures. Analyses were adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility, and expenditure by hospital referral region (high, medium, or low). The primary exposure was receipt of a billed ACP service classified as none, timely (>1 month before death), or late (first ACP visit ≤1 month before death). Results: Of the 955777 Medicare beneficiaries who met criteria for serious illness in 2016 and died in 2017 or 2018, 522737 (54.7%) were women, 764666 (80.0%) were 75 years or older, and 822684 (86.1%) were non-Hispanic White individuals. Among the study population, 81131 (8.5%) had a timely ACP visit, and an additional 22804 (2.4%) had a late ACP visit. After multivariable adjustment, compared with patients without any billed ACP visit, patients with a timely ACP visit experienced significantly less intensive EOL care on 4 of 5 measures, including in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.84-0.87), hospital admission (aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.83-0.85), intensive care unit admission (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88), and emergency department visit (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.82-0.84). Only small or insignificant differences in late hospice use or mean total EOL expenditures were noted. Compared with patients without ACP, patients with late ACP experienced more intensive EOL care, including in-hospital death (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.26), hospital admission (aOR, 5.28; 95% CI, 5.07-5.50), intensive care unit admission (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.53-1.62), and emergency department visit (aOR, 3.87; 95% CI, 3.72-4.02). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US Medicare beneficiaries, billed ACP services during the EOL course of patients with serious illness were relatively uncommon, but if they occurred before the last month of life, they were associated with less intensive use of EOL services. Further research on the variables affecting hospice use and expenditures in the EOL period and the differential effect of late ACP is recommended to understand the relative role of ACP in achieving goal-concordant care.",10.1001/jamahealthforum.2021.1829,Brigham and Women's Hospital,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,

Recent pathologic and historic data from the 1918 influenza pandemic confirms that many, if not most, of the deaths in that pandemic were a result of secondary bacterial pneumonias. This means that a second wave of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza could result in a widespread shortage of antibiotics, making these medications a scarce resource. Recently, our University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Scarce Resource Allocation Committee (SRAC) added antibiotics to a list of resources (including ventilators, antivirals, vaccines) that might become scarce during an influenza pandemic.

Recent expert opinions have been published on the safe and effective use of methadone. Objectives: To determine the success of methadone rotations and evaluate concordance with consensus recommendations by a palliative care consult service. Methods: A retrospective study of methadone rotation practice by a palliative care consult service and outcomes for patients hospitalized between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018 at a single academic medical center. A successful rotation was defined as a 30% reduction in pain or as-needed medication use sustained for at least three consecutive days. Patient outcomes were compared with expert consensus recommendations. Results: About 59 patients met the inclusion criteria. The study population was mostly Caucasian men and women of equal proportions who were started on methadone for inadequate pain control. Sixty-eight percent of patients were successfully rotated. Subjects who were rotated using a standardized protocol were six times more likely to have a successful rotation (odds ratio 6.28 [1.25–30.92]; P = 0.0238).

Significant signs of illness progression include worsening of one or more conditions, decline in function, and increase in the number of emergency department visits or hospitalizations. Prognostication refers to estimation of the remaining life expectancy. Several tools are available to inform such estimates. Prognostication should include discussion of the expected illness progression to help patients and family members prepare, plan, and cope. Advance care planning, ideally started before or early in the course of illness, should include identification of patient surrogate decision-makers as well as a discussion of patient values, priorities, and care preferences. Planning should continue and evolve to inform care plans that match patient and family member priorities at each stage of illness.

Randomization poses unique issues for such studies, especially with divergent treatment approaches and varying levels of equipoise. We report our experience accruing randomized patients to the Prospective Comparative Effectiveness Trial for Malignant Bowel Obstruction (SWOG S1316) study, comparing surgical and nonsurgical management of MBO. Methods: Patients with MBO who were surgical candidates and had treatment equipoise were accrued and offered randomization to surgical or nonsurgical management. Patients choosing nonrandomization were offered prospective observation. Trial details are listed on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT #02270450). An accrual algorithm was developed to enhance enrollment. Results: Accrual is ongoing with 176 patients enrolled. Most (89%) patients chose nonrandomization, opting for nonsurgical management. Of 25 sites that have accrued to this study, 6 enrolled patients on the randomization arm. Approximately 59% (20/34) of the randomization accrual goal has been achieved. Patient-related factors and clinician bias have been the most prevalent reasons for lack of randomization. An algorithm was developed from clinician experience to aid randomization. Using principles in this tool, repeated physician conversations discussing treatment options and goals of care, and a supportive team–approach has helped increase accrual. Conclusions: Experience gained from the S1316 study can aid future palliative care trials. Although difficult, it is possible to randomize patients to palliative studies by giving clinicians clear recommendations utilizing an algorithm of conversation, allotment of necessary time to discuss the trial, and encouragement to overcome internal bias.",10.1177/1049909119851471,Northwell Health System,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,27439187.0
Phillip Eugene Rodgers,Is This ACP? A Focus Group Study of Patient Experiences of Advance Care Planning,2022.0,Journal of General Internal Medicine,Article,Focus group analysis; Medicare; Qualitative methods; Focus group analysis; Medicare; Qualitative methods; Advance Care Planning,"2022, Society of General Internal Medicine.Background: To date, most research on patients’ experiences with advance care planning (ACP) focuses on motivations to engage in discussions and how patients prepare. Gaps remain in understanding how non-critically ill Medicare patients perceive ACP encounters, including how they characterize positive and negative experiences with ACP. Objectives: Understanding these patients’ perceptions is imperative as Medicare has sought to incentivize provision of ACP services via two billing codes in 2016. Design: Qualitative focus group study. Thematic analysis was performed to assess participants ACP experience. Participants: Medicare beneficiaries who had engaged in or were billed for ACP. Key Results: Seven focus groups were conducted with 34 Medicare beneficiaries who had engaged in ACP across 5 US health systems. Participants described a spectrum of perceptions regarding ACP, and a range of delivery approaches, including group ACP, discussions with specialists during serious illness, and ACP in primary care settings during wellness visits. Despite being billed for ACP or having ACP services noted in their medical record, many did not recognize that they had engaged in ACP, expressed lack of clarity over the term “ACP,” and were unaware of the Medicare billing codes. Among participants who described quality patient-centered ACP experiences, three additional themes were identified: trusted and established patient/clinician relationships, transparent communication and documentation, and an understanding that ACP is revisable. Participants offered recommendations for clinicians and health systems to improve the patient ACP experience. Conclusions: Findings include actionable steps to promote patient-centered ACP experiences, including clinician training to support improved communication and facilitating shared decision-making, allocating sufficient clinical time for discussions, and ensuring that documentation of preferences is clear and accessible.

Rewarding value for the care of seriously ill patients presents unique challenges. Objective: To evaluate the state of current efforts to measure and reward value for the care of seriously ill patients. Design: We performed a PubMed search of articles related to (1) measures of spending for people with serious illness and (2) linking spending and quality measures and rewarding performance for the care of people with serious illness. We limited our search to U.S.-based studies published in English between January 1, 1960, and March 31, 2017. We supplemented this search by identifying public programs and other known initiatives that linked quality and spending for the seriously ill and extracted key program elements. Results: Our search related to linking spending and quality measures and rewarding performance for the care of people with serious illness yielded 277 articles. We identified three current public programs that currently link measures of quality and spending-or are likely to within the next few years-the Oncology Care Model; the Comprehensive End-Stage Renal Disease Model; and Home Health Value-Based Purchasing. Models that link quality and spending consist of four core components: (1) measuring quality, (2) measuring spending, (3) the payment adjustment model, and (4) the linking/incentive model. We found that current efforts to reward value for seriously ill patients are targeted for specific patient populations, do not broadly encourage the use of palliative care, and have not closely aligned quality and spending measures related to palliative care.

This electronic survey seeks to explore the perceptions and prescription patterns of topical analgesics among prescribers in a large academic medical center, where the availability of topical analgesics varies. Among topical analgesics, lidocaine (78%) is prescribed more frequently than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; 41%) or morphine (3%).

Nonmedical use of prescription opioids, diversion, and overdose deaths have also increased sharply, sparking concern about the safety of these medications. Physicians considering initiation or continuation of opioid therapy for a patient with chronic nonterminal pain should first use a structured approach that includes a biopsychosocial evaluation and a treatment plan that encourages patients to set and reach functional goals. There should be a comprehensive evaluation for the cause of pain, assessment for risk of opioid complications (including misuse and addiction), and a detailed treatment history, including a review of medical records and data from the state prescription monitoring program. Opioids should be prescribed on a trial basis, to be continued only if progress toward functional goals is demonstrated. Long-acting morphine is the preferred initial drug, although several alternatives are available. Ongoing monitoring for safety and effectiveness is essential, including regular review of functional progress or maintenance, urine drug testing, and surveillance of data from the state prescription monitoring program. Ineffective, unsafe, or diverted opioid therapy should be promptly tapered or stopped. © 2012 American Academy of Family Physicians.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,

The authors sought to evaluate speaker introductions by gender in the grand rounds of multiple specialties at a large academic institution to understand the cultural context of this behavior and identify predictors of formality. Materials and Methods: The authors reviewed grand rounds recordings of speakers with doctorates presenting to the departments of family medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics at one institution from 2014 to 2019. The primary outcome was whether a speaker's professional title was used as the first form of address. The authors assessed factors correlated with professional introduction using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Speakers were introduced professionally in 346/615 recordings (56.3%). Female introducers were more likely to introduce speakers professionally (odds ratio [OR]: 2.52). A significant interaction existed between speaker gender and home institution: female speakers visiting from an external institution were less likely than male external speakers to be introduced professionally (OR: 0.49), whereas female speakers internal to the institution were more likely to be introduced professionally than male internal speakers (OR: 1.75). Use of professional titles varied by specialty and was higher than average for family medicine (83.2%), surgery (75.8%), and pediatrics (64.0%) and lower for internal medicine (37.5%) and obstetrics and gynecology (50.7%). Conclusions: These findings suggest a complex relationship between gender and formality of introduction that merits further investigation.

Objectives: To capture and describe real-time, real-world experiences of specialty palliative care professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 through a rapid reporting tool and registry. Setting: Palliative care clinicians consulted for patients either positive for COVID-19, under investigation for COVID-19, or recovered from COVID-19. Design: The PCQC created a 13-item COVID-19 case report form (CRF), modeled after the PCQC core dataset for specialty palliative care quality measurement. Twelve items offered discrete answer choices and one was open-ended. The CRF was publicized widely (e.g., social media, e-mail list serves) and completed through a link on the PCQC website. Results: Three hundred six reports (298 adult, 8 pediatric) were submitted between April 6, 2020 and October 7, 2020. The majority of patients (83%) were 50 years or older; 25% were 80 or older, and 78% were COVID-19 positive. Male gender identity was significantly more prevalent than female (58% vs. 40%, p < 0.002). The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular disease (23%). Of adult hospital-based patients, 69% were full code before palliative care consultation versus 28% after (p < 0.05). All pediatric patients were full code before and after palliative care consult. Qualitative themes were strained communication with patients, family visitation challenges, communication barriers between clinicians and families, rapid changes in palliative care medical management, community care options difficult to find, lack of testing in community-based settings, and guardianship and legal challenges. Conclusion: Preliminary data from the first 306 patients reported to the PCQC COVID-19 Registry describe palliative care use concentrated among older and higher risk patients and challenges to the provision of palliative care during this pandemic.",10.1089/jpm.2020.0440,Fuqua School of Business,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,
Phillip Eugene Rodgers,Surgical versus non-surgical management for patients with malignant bowel obstruction (S1316): a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial,2023.0,The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology,Article,"bowel obstruction, obstruction treatment, surgical management, malignant bowel, bowel, cancer trials, obstruction s1316, randomised surgery","2023 Elsevier LtdBackground: Malignant small bowel obstruction has a poor prognosis and is associated with multiple related symptoms. The optimal treatment approach is often unclear. We aimed to compare surgical versus non-surgical management with the aim to determine the optimal approach for managing malignant bowel obstruction. Methods: S1316 was a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial done within the National Cancer Trials Network at 30 hospital and cancer research centres in the USA, Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Participants had an intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal primary cancer confirmed via pathological report and malignant bowel disease; were aged 18 years or older with a Zubrod performance status 0–2 within 1 week before admission; had a surgical indication; and treatment equipoise. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to surgical or non-surgical treatment using a dynamic balancing algorithm, balancing on primary tumour type. Patients who declined consent for random assignment were offered a prospective observational patient choice pathway. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital (good days) at 91 days. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat linear, logistic, and Cox regression models combining data from both pathways and adjusting for potential confounders. Treatment complications were assessed in all analysed patients in the study. This completed study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02270450. Findings: From May 11, 2015, to April 27, 2020, 221 patients were enrolled (143 [65%] were female and 78 [35%] were male). There were 199 evaluable participants: 49 in the randomised pathway (24 surgery and 25 non-surgery) and 150 in the patient choice pathway (58 surgery and 92 non-surgery). No difference was seen between surgery and non-surgery for the primary outcome of good days: mean 42·6 days (SD 32·2) in the randomised surgery group, 43·9 days (29·5) in the randomised non-surgery group, 54·8 days (27·0) in the patient choice surgery group, and 52·7 days (30·7) in the patient choice non-surgery group (adjusted mean difference 2·9 additional good days in surgical versus non-surgical treatment [95% CI –5·5 to 11·3]; p=0·50). During their initial hospital stay, six participants died, five due to cancer progression (four patients from the randomised pathway, two in each treatment group, and one from the patient choice pathway, in the surgery group) and one due to malignant bowel obstruction treatment complications (patient choice pathway, non-surgery). The most common grade 3–4 malignant bowel obstruction treatment complication was anaemia (three [6%] patients in the randomised pathway, all in the surgical group, and five [3%] patients in the patient choice pathway, four in the surgical group and one in the non-surgical group). Interpretation: In our study, whether patients received a surgical or non-surgical treatment approach did not influence good days during the first 91 days after registration. These findings should inform treatment decisions for patients hospitalised with malignant bowel obstruction. Funding: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Cancer Institute.

Despite recent increases, use of these codes remains low for reasons incompletely captured by quantitative research. To further identify barriers and facilitators to code use for Medicare fee-for-service enrollees, we conducted case studies at eleven health systems, including 272 interviews with clinicians, administrators, and key leadership. Five themes related to use of the new codes emerged: codebased constraints to billing, burdening patients with unexpected charges, ethical concerns with billing for discussion of advance care plans, incentives to signal the importance of their use in billing, and increasing both workflow burden and the need for institutional supports and training. Respondents also observed that use was facilitated by health systems’ investment in clinician training and in processes to audit the codes’ use. Our findings suggest that increased reimbursement, strong institutional commitment and support, and streamlined workflow could improve the use of the new CPT codes to document receipt of and ensure access to Medicare advance care planning.",10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00848,Tufts University,0000-0003-2729-7783,7102858739.0,

Sutures, tissue adhesives, staples, and skin-closure tapes are options in the outpatient setting. Physicians should be familiar with various suturing techniques, including simple, running, and half-buried mattress (corner) sutures. Although suturing is the preferred method for laceration repair, tissue adhesives are similar in patient satisfaction, infection rates, and scarring risk in low skin-tension areas and may be more cost-effective. The tissue adhesive hair apposition technique also is effective in repairing scalp lacerations. The sting of local anesthesia injections can be lessened by using smaller gauge needles, administering the injection slowly, and warming or buffering the solution. Studies have shown that tap water is safe to use for irrigation, that white petrolatum ointment is as effective as antibiotic ointment in postprocedure care, and that wetting the wound as early as 12 hours after repair does not increase the risk of infection.

The microfluidic device consists of a tissue compartment flanked by vascular channels, allowing for the co-culture of multiple cell types and providing a wide range of culturing conditions in one device. Methods: Human metastatic, drug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells (SUM159PTX) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used to model the TME. A dynamic perfusion scheme was employed to facilitate EC physiological function and lumen formation. Results: The measured permeability of the EC barrier was comparable to observed microvessels permeability in vivo. The TNBC cells formed a 3D tumor, and co-culture with HUVEC negatively impacted EC barrier integrity. The microfluidic TME was then used to model the intravenous route of drug delivery. Paclitaxel (PTX) and a novel non-apoptotic agent TPH104c were introduced via the vascular channels and successfully reached the TNBC tumor, resulting in both time and concentration-dependent tumor growth inhibition. PTX treatment significantly reduced EC barrier integrity, highlighting the adverse effects of PTX on vascular ECs. TPH104c preserved EC barrier integrity and prevented TNBC intravasation. Discussion: In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of microfluidics for studying complex biological processes in a controlled environment and evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in more physiologically relevant conditions. This model can be a valuable tool for screening potential anticancer drugs and developing personalized cancer treatment strategies.",10.3389/fbioe.2023.1227119,College of Engineering,0009-0002-5189-3411,57194255959.0,

A tailored primary care approach for this vulnerable population that also accounts for social and functional risk factors could promote healthier aging and more equitable health care. Objective: This project will evaluate the implementation of a health program designed for people with physical disabilities. The proposed evaluation result is to generate the first best-practice protocol focused specifically on developing primary care to help reduce preventable causes of morbidity and improve functioning among people with physical disabilities. Methods: We will design and implement a pilot health program for people with physical disabilities at a primary care clinic within Michigan Medicine. The health program for people with physical disabilities will be an integrated intervention involving a tailored best practice alert designed to prompt family medicine providers to screen and monitor for common, preventable health conditions. The program will also collect social and functional status information to determine the patient’s need for further care coordination and support. Adult participants from this clinic with identified physical disabilities will be targeted for potential enrollment. To create a quasi-experimental setting, a separate departmental clinic will serve as a control site for comparison purposes. A quantitative analysis to estimate the treatment effect of implementing this health program will be conducted using a difference-in-differences approach. Outcomes of interest will include the use of preventative services (eg, hemoglobin A1c for diabetes screening), social work assistance, and emergency and hospital services. These data will be extracted from electronic health records. Time-invariant covariates, particularly sociodemographic covariates, will be included in the models. A qualitative analysis of patient and health care provider interviews will also be completed to assess the effect of the health program. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scores will be assessed to both screen for depression and anxiety as well as explore program impacts related to addressing health and functioning needs related to physical disabilities in a primary care setting. These will be summarized through descriptive analyses. Results: This study was funded in September 2018, data collection started in September 2021, and data collection is expected to be concluded in September 2023. Conclusions: This study is a mixed methods evaluation of the effectiveness of an integrated health program designed for people with physical disabilities, based on a quasi-experimental comparison between an intervention and a control clinic site. The intervention will be considered successful if it leads to improvements in greater use of screening and monitoring for preventable health conditions, increased social worker referrals to assist with health and functioning needs, and improvements in emergency and hospital-based services. The findings will help inform best practices for people with physical disabilities in a primary care setting.",10.2196/50105,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0694-4702,57194255959.0,

New interns typically learn the sterile cervical exam on the job by examining women in labor. This can be uncomfortable for patients and may increase the risk of infection. Simulated training could minimize these challenges, but manufactured models are expensive and not widely available in residency programs. We sought to evaluate a simple, homemade sewn model using stretchy fabric and pipe cleaners that could improve teaching and acquisition of cervical examination skills and common obstetrical procedures. Methods: We used the model to teach cervical examination skills to students and new interns and assessed participant satisfaction. We evaluated examination accuracy by grading practice exams on the model before and after a workshop teaching obstetrical procedures including the sterile vaginal exam. We calculated satisfaction using summary statistics. We evaluated pre-and postscores for exam accuracy using paired t tests. Results: Interns demonstrated a significant improvement in cervical exam skills using the model, and participants reported very high satisfaction with the workshop utilizing the model. Conclusions: We developed a simple, low-cost cervical exam model that was shown to be well-regarded by trainees and could be duplicated by other residency programs.

Innovative approaches might reinforce family physician participation in pregnancy care for the underserved. Since group prenatal visits have been shown to improve patient education, support, and satisfaction, we implemented and evaluated a group prenatal visit program for Japanese women in Michigan, an under-served population because of their limited proficiency with English. Methods: We conducted a convergent quantitative and qualitative mixed methods evaluation involving repeated survey administration (program evaluations, 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire, pregnancy distress questionnaire) to participants during 5 group visits and in-depth postpartum interviews in the University of Michigan Japanese Family Health Program setting. We conducted independent quantitative and qualitative analytics and then thematically integrated these data. Results: Cultural adaptations to the Centering Pregnancy format involved changes in total visits, educational content, and participation format. Based on 5 groups attending 5 sessions each, 42 women evaluated the program through 158 surveys after the sessions. Participants evaluated multiple parameters positively: being with other pregnant women (98%), improving their understanding about prenatal care (96%), preparation for labor and delivery (96%), organization of visits (94%), and preparation for newborn care (85%). In final evaluations, 96% to 100% of participants rated 7 educational topics as ""covered"" or ""covered well."" Qualitative interviews with 20 women revealed positive views of social support from prenatal group visits and group facilitation but mixed enthusiasm for clinical assessments in the prenatal group visit setting and partner and chidren attendance at the sessions.

Numerous non-pharmacological interventions provide a route to address this behavioural risk factor linked to the growth of non-communicable diseases. Here, we consider a nature-based intervention, specifically group outdoor health walks (GOHW), as a non-pharmacological intervention to increase physical activity and contribute to health and quality of life amongst older adults. We used the theoretically grounded Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model as a lens to examine interviews with participants in a GOHW with an activity tracker and signposted by health clinics in Scotland, UK. Analysis identified capabilities, opportunities, and motivations, their impact on behaviour, and perceived physical and mental health. The application of the COM-B model to intervention evaluation allowed us to examine two separate behaviours, that of (i) engaging with the intervention itself, and (ii) incorporating the behaviour into one’s life that the intervention targets. Analysis identified emerging capabilities, opportunities, and motivations that supported additional health-promoting behaviours, including increased time outdoors in nature and leadership to self-organise continued group walks. We offer insight into the design of nature-based interventions to effectively engage older adults with chronic health conditions and foster personal behaviour change for health and well-being.",10.3390/ijerph21070843,The James Hutton Institute,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Allergy published by European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Planetary health provides a perspective of ecological interdependence that connects the health and vitality of individuals, communities, and Earth's natural systems. It includes the social, political, and economic ecosystems that influence both individuals and whole societies. In an era of interconnected grand challenges threatening health of all systems at all scales, planetary health provides a framework for cross-sectoral collaboration and unified systems approaches to solutions. The field of allergy is at the forefront of these efforts. Allergic conditions are a sentinel measure of environmental impact on human health in early life—illuminating how ecological changes affect immune development and predispose to a wider range of inflammatory noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This shows how adverse macroscale ecology in the Anthropocene penetrates to the molecular level of personal and microscale ecology, including the microbial systems at the foundations of all ecosystems. It provides the basis for more integrated efforts to address widespread environmental degradation and adverse effects of maladaptive urbanization, food systems, lifestyle behaviors, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Nature-based solutions and efforts to improve nature-relatedness are crucial for restoring symbiosis, balance, and mutualism in every sense, recognizing that both personal lifestyle choices and collective structural actions are needed in tandem. Ultimately, meaningful ecological approaches will depend on placing greater emphasis on psychological and cultural dimensions such as mindfulness, values, and moral wisdom to ensure a sustainable and resilient future.",10.1111/all.15419,UWA Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Physical distancing practices during the COVID-19 global pandemic contributed to a high degree of social isolation among older adults. To reduce loneliness and other ill effects of social isolation, public health experts recommended outdoor social gathering, with physical distancing. Adopting a case study approach, we explored how social aspects of group outdoor health walks (GOHWs) mitigate social isolation for older adults and improve individual social wellbeing. We used semi-structured interviews to understand the experiences of social isolation and social relationships in nine older (50–80 s) adults participating in a GOHW in Scotland, United Kingdom (UK). Verbatim transcripts were analysed through an iterative process of thematic analysis carried out by an interdisciplinary team of qualitative researchers from environmental psychology, medicine, and geography. Themes provide insight into the social dimensions of GOHWs, the mediating effects of social experiences, and the contribution these make to individual social wellbeing. GOHWs provide opportunities to be part of a group and attend to the needs of inexperienced or physically challenged individuals. Being part of the group walk fosters casual interpersonal interactions through spontaneous mixing during and after the walk. This programmatic structure counters loneliness, en-genders pleasurable anticipation of regular contact with others, supports physical activity, and fosters group cohesion. These in turn contribute to individual social wellbeing, including expanding social networks, meaningful relationships, a sense of belonging, and acting on empathy for others. GOWHs may be beneficial for mitigation of social isolation as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings were used to propose a conceptual model to parse social constructs and inform selection or development of quantitative social measures for future studies of nature-based interventions such as GOHWs.",10.3390/ijerph19095353,The James Hutton Institute,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

We sought to understand the phenomenon of transcendent experiences. We spoke with 67 pilgrims including assisted pilgrims, young volunteers and medical staff. About two in five reported a transcendent experience: some felt they had communicated or had close contact with a divine presence, while others reported a powerful experience of something intangible and otherworldly.

All rights reserved.The “Earthrise” photograph, taken on the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, became one of the most significant images of the 20th Century. It triggered a profound shift in environmental awareness and the potential for human unity—inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the necessity of a “Great Transition”. While ambitious integrative efforts have never been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with advancing global urbanization in the digital age—for personal, environmental, economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting the inspiration of “Earthrise”, we welcome diverse perspectives from across all dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new normative values. Building on academic rigor, we seek to place greater value on imagination, kindness and mutualism as we address our greatest challenges, for the health of people, places and planet.",10.3390/ijerph182010654,UWA Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,
Sara L Warber,Pathways linking biodiversity to human health: A conceptual framework,2021.0,Environment International,Review,Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Human well-being; Mediation; Nature; Public health,"2021 The Author(s)Biodiversity is a cornerstone of human health and well-being. However, while evidence of the contributions of nature to human health is rapidly building, research into how biodiversity relates to human health remains limited in important respects. In particular, a better mechanistic understanding of the range of pathways through which biodiversity can influence human health is needed. These pathways relate to both psychological and social processes as well as biophysical processes. Building on evidence from across the natural, social and health sciences, we present a conceptual framework organizing the pathways linking biodiversity to human health. Four domains of pathways—both beneficial as well as harmful—link biodiversity with human health: (i) reducing harm (e.g. provision of medicines, decreasing exposure to air and noise pollution); (ii) restoring capacities (e.g. attention restoration, stress reduction); (iii) building capacities (e.g. promoting physical activity, transcendent experiences); and (iv) causing harm (e.g. dangerous wildlife, zoonotic diseases, allergens). We discuss how to test components of the biodiversity-health framework with available analytical approaches and existing datasets. In a world with accelerating declines in biodiversity, profound land-use change, and an increase in non-communicable and zoonotic diseases globally, greater understanding of these pathways can reinforce biodiversity conservation as a strategy for the promotion of health for both people and nature. We conclude by identifying research avenues and recommendations for policy and practice to foster biodiversity-focused public health actions.",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106420,German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Sara L Warber,Methods for Integrating Transdisciplinary Teams in Support of Reciprocal Healing: A Case Study,2020.0,Ecopsychology,Article,Emergent strategy; Environmental change; Environmental psychology; Mixed methods research; Nature-health; Team development,"Sara L. Warber et al., 2020; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2020.We live in a time of accelerated environmental change. Links between ecosystem health and human health and well-being are increasingly recognized with ever more awareness of impending environmental catastrophe. There is a need for reciprocal healing on multiple scales. Transdisciplinary teams have the potential to address complex socioecological problems, yet they also have inherent challenges. There is a need for new ways of working. This paper details a collaborative and emergent process undertaken to address these challenges. The methods - a combination of established and novel techniques - are important for facilitating transdisciplinary team development and eliciting commitment to shared work. As an example, we share a case study of team building including exploration of literature about environment and health that will inform future work within a multiphase project, Women's Dreams. Grounded in an emergent strategy approach that values addressing complex changes through relatively small interactions, our process incorporated six methods: individual mind mapping, bibliomancy, group processing using sticky notes and paper, group mind mapping, free writing, and synthetic reflection. Emergent themes included healing, story-culture, encountering nature, place, invitation, re-membering, and gathering together. Recurring concepts running through these themes focused on dis-ease, relationship, ways of being, wild wisdom, and reimagining the future. Along with a generative method of team building, we offer invitations to action, both personal and collective, for cultivating reciprocal healing and a future that is more directly sustainable for all, human and more-than-human.",10.1089/eco.2020.0008,University of Exeter Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

The challenges of such NBIs include the motivation of inactive adults to participate and measurement issues. This feasibility study investigates a 12-week group outdoor health walk (GOHW) incorporating activity trackers and use of a holistic health and wellbeing measure, the Self-sasessment of Change (SAC) scale. A mixed methods design explored participant recruitment and retention, programme delivery, and measures of physical activity and health and wellbeing. Walker data included: Pre-post questionnaires, daily step counts, and interviews. Programme delivery information included: Weekly checklists, staff reflections, stakeholder meeting minutes, and a report. Thirteen adults (age 63-81, 76% female) joined and completed the activity tracker GOHW. Activity trackers motivated walkers to join and be more active but complicated programme delivery. Activity trackers allowed the quantification of physical activity and the SAC health and wellbeing measure was easy to use. By week 12, all participants met national physical activity guidelines. Clinically relevant changes on the SAC scale included: Sleeping well, experiencing vibrant senses, and feeling energised, focused, joyful, calm and whole. Results illustrate the feasibility of using activity trackers to motivate engagement in and provide a measure of physical activity from GOHWs. The SAC scale offers a promising measure for nature-health research. A conceptual model is provided for the development of future large-scale studies of NBIs, such as group outdoor health walks.",10.3390/ijerph17072515,The James Hutton Institute,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

However, as we shall see, this is not always the case. In biomedical discourses, healing is generally used to describe the body’s intrinsic ability to mend a wound or a broken bone. But when complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners or the general public use the word they often mean something different and much more “holistic”; it may involve mending again, but mending of our whole selves, including concepts such as the (re)integration of body, mind, and soul [1]. The word “healing” can be used as a noun (e.g., “I have had healing”), a verb (e.g., “I am healing you”), or an adjective (e.g., “this is a healing environment”). Furthermore, it can be used to refer to individuals, to groups and communities, to animals and plants, to the environment, or the whole world.",10.1017/9781108650182.042,University of Exeter Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

We examined associations between recreational nature contact in the last seven days and self-reported health and well-being. Participants (n = 19,806) were drawn from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment Survey (2014/15–2015/16); weighted to be nationally representative. Weekly contact was categorised using 60 min blocks. Analyses controlled for residential greenspace and other neighbourhood and individual factors. Compared to no nature contact last week, the likelihood of reporting good health or high well-being became significantly greater with contact ≥120 mins (e.g. 120–179 mins: ORs [95%CIs]: Health = 1.59 [1.31–1.92]; Well-being = 1.23 [1.08–1.40]). Positive associations peaked between 200–300 mins per week with no further gain. The pattern was consistent across key groups including older adults and those with long-term health issues. It did not matter how 120 mins of contact a week was achieved (e.g. one long vs. several shorter visits/week).

Sara L Warber,Why and How Should We Integrate Biomarkers into Complex Trials? A Discussion on Paradigms and Clinical Research Strategies,2019.0,Complementary Medicine Research,Review,Biomarkers; Complementary and alternative medicine; Complex interventions; Integrative medicine; Traditional medicine; Trial methodology; Whole medical systems,"2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: Research in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encounters a variety of challenges, such as potentially synergistic, multimodal, and complex interventions which are often dependent on the relationship between practitioner and patient, on specific settings, and on patients' individual preferences, expectations, beliefs, and motivations. Moreover, patients seeking CAM care often suffer from chronic disease conditions, and multiple symptoms and/or pathologies. On the other hand, CAM interventions are often challenged as being solely dependent on subjective and nonspecific factors without biologically based mechanisms of action. If we agree that biomarkers as outcomes are important for the understanding of CAM interventions, a hypothesis- and strategy-driven process for the selection of the most appropriate biomarkers is needed. Methods: This paper presents the results of an expert panel on how to integrate biomarkers in whole system research of an interdisciplinary workshop on research methodology in CAM held in November 2012. Results: The following main CAM research challenges were identified: (a) finding appropriate biomarkers, which are able to picture the complex pathophysiological pathways and likewise complex interventions under study; (b) integrating these biomarkers into clinical trials in CAM; and (c) identifying the biomarkers specific to the particular CAM intervention being applied. Conclusion: The paper provides a disease/condition/symptom- and intervention-driven strategy regarding how to identify the outcomes of interest and possible related biomarkers. The research approach presented here allows the selected biomarkers to be grounded in conventional physiology/pathophysiology as well as complementary and alternative concepts, including traditional systems of medicine. The goal is to provide researchers in the field with a framework on how to integrate biomarkers into complex trials.",10.1159/000498981,UiT Norges Arktiske Universitet,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,
Sara L Warber,Understanding public perceptions of healing: An arts-based qualitative study,2019.0,Complementary Therapies in Medicine,Article,Creative methods; Healing; Public views; Qualitative research,"2019 Elsevier LtdBackground: Most healing research has focussed on the views of healers, complementary and alternative medical (CAM)practitioners or medical professionals, and little is known about how the general public conceives of healing. Because healing is a complex and often abstract concept, we addressed this gap in the knowledge using creative qualitative approaches with members of the public. We aimed to elucidate the views of members of the public about their healing, to help offer a better understanding to healthcare professionals. Methods: Our qualitative arts-based drawing method invited people to respond using crayons and paper to the question ‘What does the word healing mean to you?’ These drawings were followed by a short recorded interview in which people explained their image. We used convenience sampling to approach members of the public visiting a large wellbeing show and a museum. We analysed images and interviews in tandem using a focus on metaphor. Results: We interviewed 59 people, including three children. Almost two thirds of participants were female. Participants’ images and interviews documented three main models of the healing process: i)Healing comes from a great external force, exemplified by the sun; ii)Healing comes from other people, whether medical professionals, CAM practitioners or healers; and iii)Healing comes from within, and the individual has the ability to self-heal. People described practices and inner states that could help achieve healing. Some people depicted more than one model, demonstrating the interlinkages between the models, and some described the outcome of healing (wholeness)rather than the process. Conclusions: The drawing-based approach encouraged an intuitive way of thinking, capturing concepts that cannot easily be verbalised. Members of the public have nuanced, complex understandings of the concept of healing, and these echo historical and modern concepts of healing and healthcare. The models our participants described often interlink, suggesting an overarching framework for the way people conceive of healing.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Engagement with nature is an important part of many people’s lives, and the health and wellbeing benefits of nature–based activities are becoming increasingly recognised across disciplines from city planning to medicine. Despite this, urbanisation, challenges of modern life and environmental degradation are leading to a reduction in both the quantity and the quality of nature experiences. Nature–based health interventions (NBIs) can facilitate behavioural change through a somewhat structured promotion of nature–based experiences and, in doing so, promote improved physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. We conducted a Delphi expert elicitation process with 19 experts from seven countries (all named authors on this paper) to identify the different forms that such interventions take, the potential health outcomes and the target beneficiaries. In total, 27 NBIs were identified, aiming to prevent illness, promote wellbeing and treat specific physical, mental or social health and wellbeing conditions. These interventions were broadly categorized into those that change the environment in which people live, work, learn, recreate or heal (for example, the provision of gardens in hospitals or parks in cities) and those that change behaviour (for example, engaging people through organized programmes or other activities). We also noted the range of factors (such as socioeconomic variation) that will inevitably influence the extent to which these interventions succeed. We conclude with a call for research to identify the drivers influencing the effectiveness of NBIs in enhancing health and wellbeing.",10.3390/sports7060141,Zealandia Centre for People and Nature,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Methods: A survey of UK-based healers was undertaken with the help of The Confederation of Healing Organisations, asking healers to report on up to 20 consultations. Forms asked about the demography of healer and client, reasons for the consultation, type of healing, and outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results: 278 returned forms from 39 healers (average age 58) were analysed. Healing was described as Spiritual (69%), Reiki (15%) or Energy (10%). The clients had an average age of 57, and 76% were women. The most common reasons for consulting were mental health problems and pain. 93% of the clients reported experiencing immediate benefits. Relaxation, improved wellbeing and relief of pain were often reported. In addition, 76 (27%) had some unusual sensory experiences during the session, such as feelings of warmth, seeing coloured lights, or tingling sensations. The majority of general comments about the experience were positive, and 68% made another appointment. Conclusions: Older people, particularly older women, are the main recipients of healing in the UK, and they go for help with many problems, particularly mental health issues and pain. The majority have a positive experience, and come back for more. In addition to relief of symptoms, many have sensory experiences which could indicate that some special type of interaction was taking place between healer and healee.",10.1016/j.ctcp.2019.01.012,University of Exeter Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Nature-based activities have been used as therapeutic interventions for those experiencing stress and mental ill health. This study investigates whether group walks could be a nature-based intervention to foster resilience, by buffering the effects of recent stressful life events on mental health. An observational research design with propensity score-matched samples compared the mental health of individuals who did (Nature Group Walkers, n = 1081) or did not (Non-Group Walkers, n = 435) attend nature group walks. A sub-sample of Frequent Nature Group Walkers (at least once per week, n = 631) was also investigated. Data were analyzed using multiple regression with an interaction term. All analyses were controlled for age, gender, and recent physical activity. Results showed that neither nature group walking, nor doing this frequently, moderated the effects of stressful life events on mental health. Using a main effects model, the positive associations of group walks in nature were at a greater magnitude than the negative associations of stressful life events on depression, positive affect, and mental well-being, suggesting an ‘undoing’ effect of nature group walks.

Sara L Warber,Transformational Changes in Health Status: A Qualitative Exploration of Healing Moments,2017.0,Explore,Article,connectivity; healing; transformational change,"2017 Elsevier Inc.Background and Aims Dramatic self-change is a familiar concept within religious experience and is recognized within psychotherapy and some fields of nursing. However, it has been given limited consideration in wider health research, including healing research. We sought to explore the phenomenon of “healing moments”. Methods Alternative medicine practitioners attending a continuing professional development course for healers within the UK's Holistic Health Show were shown a 10 min video clip showing two of the authors discussing healing moments. Sixty-nine (69) of the practitioners then provided “short stories” outlining their own experiences of such moments. Both the video and the short stories were analyzed qualitatively using a thematic approach. We sought to evaluate holistic practitioners’ perceptions of the concept of healing moments. Results The concept of healing moments was widely accepted by the 69 participants. An overarching theme of transformational change described personal shifts that ranged from the sudden and quasimiraculous to transient but much-needed improvements in health and wellbeing. Three subordinate themes of connectivity, quiescence and control were identified. Connectivity described intense connections, experienced through touch, empathy and love, which could provide reciprocal benefits for healers as well as clients. Quiescence captured the quiet, calm atmosphere that pervaded many healing episodes. The contrasting aspects of control encompassed healers relinquishing control to channel healing, and clients seizing control to become empowered in their own healing process. Conclusion Healing moments are a recognized and distinct concept within healing, although they remain under-explored in the literature. Our findings suggest that such experiences are common among alternative medicine practitioners. The concepts we uncovered can inform future research.",10.1016/j.explore.2017.06.005,University of Exeter Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

All rights reserved.Objectives To elucidate pathways to healing for people having suffered injury to the integrity of their function as a human being. Methods A team of physician-analysts conducted thematic analyses of in-depth interviews of 23 patients who experienced healing, as identified by six primary care physicians purposefully selected as exemplary healers. Results People in the sample experienced healing journeys that spanned a spectrum from overcoming unspeakable trauma and then becoming healers themselves to everyday heroes functioning well despite ongoing serious health challenges. The degree and quality of suffering experienced by each individual is framed by contextual factors that include personal characteristics, timing of their initial or ongoing wounding in the developmental life cycle and prior and current relationships. In the healing journey, bridges from suffering are developed to healing resources/skills and connections to helpers outside themselves. These bridges often evolve in fits and starts and involve persistence and developing a sense of safety and trust. From the iteration between suffering and developing resources and connections, a new state emerges that involves hope, self-acceptance and helping others. Over time, this leads to healing that includes a sense of integrity and flourishing in the pursuit of meaningful goals and purpose. Conclusion Moving from being wounded, through suffering to healing, is possible. It is facilitated by developing safe, trusting relationships and by positive reframing that moves through the weight of responsibility to the ability to respond.",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016771,Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,
Sara L Warber,"What approaches to social prescribing work, for whom, and in what circumstances? A protocol for a realist review",2016.0,Systematic Reviews,Article,Community referral; Mental health; Primary care; Realist review; Social prescribing,"2016 The Author(s).Background: The use of non-drug, non-health-service interventions has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative to help those with long-term conditions manage their illness and improve their health and well-being. Interventions typically involve accessing activities run by the third sector or community agencies and may also be described as non-medical referral, community referral or social prescribing. To be effective, patients need to be ""transferred"" from the primary care setting into the community and to maintain their participation in activities. However, it is not currently known how and why these approaches enable which people under what circumstances to reach community services that may benefit their health and well-being. Methods: Database searches and extensive searching of grey sources will be carried out in an attempt to find evidence associated with referral and retention in social prescribing. After initial scoping searches, two main phases of searching will be conducted: (a) will focus on the identification of programme theories to illustrate how approaches to social prescribing work for different people and in different contexts and (b) will consist of targeted searches to locate evidence to refine these candidate theories into configurations of the contexts in which populations and the main mechanisms outcomes are achieved. Inclusion criteria will initially be broad in order to develop a clear picture of the ways in which social prescriptions might operate but may iteratively become more focused in response to initially identified evidence, for example, in terms of the population group. An expert advisory group consisting of professionals working in a range of organisations involved in social prescribing will be convened to check the approaches in the review and provide real-life experience of social prescribing. Findings from the review will be disseminated to commissioners, published in a peer-reviewed journal and used to help refine an intervention model for an outdoor nature-based group intervention. Discussion: This realist review will explore why mechanisms of social prescribing work, for what groups of people and their impact on enrolment, attendance and adherence to programmes. The use of realist approaches to detail the social prescribing process is novel and will offer insights into effective transfer of patients.

Nature-deficit disorder, a journalistic term proposed to describe the ill effects of people’s alienation from nature, is not yet formally recognized as a medical diagnosis. However, over the past decade, the phrase has been enthusiastically taken up by some segments of the lay public. Social media, such as Twitter, with its opportunities to gather “big data” related to public opinions, offers a medium for exploring the discourse and dissemination around nature-deficit disorder and other nature–health concepts. In this paper, we report our experience of collecting more than 175,000 tweets, applying sentiment analysis to measure positive, neutral or negative feelings, and preliminarily mapping the impact on dissemination. Sentiment analysis is currently used to investigate the repercussions of events in social networks, scrutinize opinions about products and services, and understand various aspects of the communication in Web-based communities. Based on a comparison of nature-deficit-disorder “hashtags” and more generic nature hashtags, we make recommendations for the better dissemination of public health messages through changes to the framing of messages. We show the potential of Twitter to aid in better understanding the impact of the natural environment on human health and wellbeing.",10.3390/ijerph13010142,Robert Gordon University,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Participants (n = 127) of a national group walk program completed pre- and post-walk questionnaires for each walk attended (n = 1009) within a 13-week study period. Multilevel linear modelling was used to examine the main and moderation effects. To isolate the environmental from the physical activity elements, analyses controlled for walk duration and perceived intensity. Analyses revealed that perceived restorativeness and perceived walk intensity predicted greater positive affect and happiness following an outdoor group walk. Perceived restorativeness and perceived bird biodiversity predicted post-walk negative affect. Perceived restorativeness moderated the relationship between perceived naturalness and positive affect. Results suggest that restorative quality of an environment may be an important element for enhancing well-being, and that perceived restorativeness and naturalness of an environment may interact to amplify positive affect. These findings highlight the importance of further research on the contribution of environment type and quality on well-being, and the need to control for effects of physical activity in green exercise research.",10.3390/ijerph120100106,Edge Hill University,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Numerous non-pharmacological interventions provide a route to address this behavioural risk factor linked to the growth of non-communicable diseases. Here, we consider a nature-based intervention, specifically group outdoor health walks (GOHW), as a non-pharmacological intervention to increase physical activity and contribute to health and quality of life amongst older adults. We used the theoretically grounded Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour (COM-B) model as a lens to examine interviews with participants in a GOHW with an activity tracker and signposted by health clinics in Scotland, UK. Analysis identified capabilities, opportunities, and motivations, their impact on behaviour, and perceived physical and mental health. The application of the COM-B model to intervention evaluation allowed us to examine two separate behaviours, that of (i) engaging with the intervention itself, and (ii) incorporating the behaviour into one’s life that the intervention targets. Analysis identified emerging capabilities, opportunities, and motivations that supported additional health-promoting behaviours, including increased time outdoors in nature and leadership to self-organise continued group walks. We offer insight into the design of nature-based interventions to effectively engage older adults with chronic health conditions and foster personal behaviour change for health and well-being.",10.3390/ijerph21070843,The James Hutton Institute,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,51961243.0

Acupuncture is relatively common in Japan, but no previous research has evaluated its use in rural Japanese populations. Objective: To evaluate the use of acupuncture in rural Japanese populations. Design: By using a Japanese version of the International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q), a cross-sectional survey was conducted in three family medicine clinics in rural Japan. This work extends findings of a previous study about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in general to focus specifically on acupuncture use. Participants: Patients and visitors to the three clinic sites were invited to participate. Results: Of the 340 respondents who answered questions regarding acupuncture, 29 were categorized as acupuncture users (8.5%). Acupuncture users were less likely to have a higher education degree (26% vs. 49%; P = 0.05) and had worse self-rated health scores (P = 0.08) than nonusers. A higher proportion of users had neurologic (28% vs. 11%; P = 0.02) and gynecologic (24% vs. 12%, P = 0.06) health problems. Acupuncture users were more likely to use other CAM treatments and see other CAM providers. Conclusions: Acupuncture use is relatively common in rural Japanese populations. As in previous studies, individuals with chronic illnesses were more likely to use acupuncture. These data fill a gap in the literature regarding acupuncture use in rural Japan and reinforces the notion that primary care providers in rural Japan should familiarize themselves with acupuncture and the indications for acupuncture use.",10.1089/acu.2015.1162,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Methods: A survey of UK-based healers was undertaken with the help of The Confederation of Healing Organisations, asking healers to report on up to 20 consultations. Forms asked about the demography of healer and client, reasons for the consultation, type of healing, and outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results: 278 returned forms from 39 healers (average age 58) were analysed. Healing was described as Spiritual (69%), Reiki (15%) or Energy (10%). The clients had an average age of 57, and 76% were women. The most common reasons for consulting were mental health problems and pain. 93% of the clients reported experiencing immediate benefits. Relaxation, improved wellbeing and relief of pain were often reported. In addition, 76 (27%) had some unusual sensory experiences during the session, such as feelings of warmth, seeing coloured lights, or tingling sensations. The majority of general comments about the experience were positive, and 68% made another appointment. Conclusions: Older people, particularly older women, are the main recipients of healing in the UK, and they go for help with many problems, particularly mental health issues and pain. The majority have a positive experience, and come back for more.

Allergy published by European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Planetary health provides a perspective of ecological interdependence that connects the health and vitality of individuals, communities, and Earth's natural systems. It includes the social, political, and economic ecosystems that influence both individuals and whole societies. In an era of interconnected grand challenges threatening health of all systems at all scales, planetary health provides a framework for cross-sectoral collaboration and unified systems approaches to solutions. The field of allergy is at the forefront of these efforts. Allergic conditions are a sentinel measure of environmental impact on human health in early life—illuminating how ecological changes affect immune development and predispose to a wider range of inflammatory noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This shows how adverse macroscale ecology in the Anthropocene penetrates to the molecular level of personal and microscale ecology, including the microbial systems at the foundations of all ecosystems. It provides the basis for more integrated efforts to address widespread environmental degradation and adverse effects of maladaptive urbanization, food systems, lifestyle behaviors, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Nature-based solutions and efforts to improve nature-relatedness are crucial for restoring symbiosis, balance, and mutualism in every sense, recognizing that both personal lifestyle choices and collective structural actions are needed in tandem.

The challenges of such NBIs include the motivation of inactive adults to participate and measurement issues. This feasibility study investigates a 12-week group outdoor health walk (GOHW) incorporating activity trackers and use of a holistic health and wellbeing measure, the Self-sasessment of Change (SAC) scale. A mixed methods design explored participant recruitment and retention, programme delivery, and measures of physical activity and health and wellbeing. Walker data included: Pre-post questionnaires, daily step counts, and interviews. Programme delivery information included: Weekly checklists, staff reflections, stakeholder meeting minutes, and a report. Thirteen adults (age 63-81, 76% female) joined and completed the activity tracker GOHW. Activity trackers motivated walkers to join and be more active but complicated programme delivery. Activity trackers allowed the quantification of physical activity and the SAC health and wellbeing measure was easy to use. By week 12, all participants met national physical activity guidelines. Clinically relevant changes on the SAC scale included: Sleeping well, experiencing vibrant senses, and feeling energised, focused, joyful, calm and whole. Results illustrate the feasibility of using activity trackers to motivate engagement in and provide a measure of physical activity from GOHWs. The SAC scale offers a promising measure for nature-health research.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Nature-based activities have been used as therapeutic interventions for those experiencing stress and mental ill health. This study investigates whether group walks could be a nature-based intervention to foster resilience, by buffering the effects of recent stressful life events on mental health. An observational research design with propensity score-matched samples compared the mental health of individuals who did (Nature Group Walkers, n = 1081) or did not (Non-Group Walkers, n = 435) attend nature group walks. A sub-sample of Frequent Nature Group Walkers (at least once per week, n = 631) was also investigated. Data were analyzed using multiple regression with an interaction term. All analyses were controlled for age, gender, and recent physical activity. Results showed that neither nature group walking, nor doing this frequently, moderated the effects of stressful life events on mental health. Using a main effects model, the positive associations of group walks in nature were at a greater magnitude than the negative associations of stressful life events on depression, positive affect, and mental well-being, suggesting an ‘undoing’ effect of nature group walks.

However, as we shall see, this is not always the case. In biomedical discourses, healing is generally used to describe the body’s intrinsic ability to mend a wound or a broken bone. But when complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners or the general public use the word they often mean something different and much more “holistic”; it may involve mending again, but mending of our whole selves, including concepts such as the (re)integration of body, mind, and soul [1]. The word “healing” can be used as a noun (e.g., “I have had healing”), a verb (e.g., “I am healing you”), or an adjective (e.g., “this is a healing environment”).

Methods A team of physician-analysts conducted thematic analyses of in-depth interviews of 23 patients who experienced healing, as identified by six primary care physicians purposefully selected as exemplary healers. Results People in the sample experienced healing journeys that spanned a spectrum from overcoming unspeakable trauma and then becoming healers themselves to everyday heroes functioning well despite ongoing serious health challenges. The degree and quality of suffering experienced by each individual is framed by contextual factors that include personal characteristics, timing of their initial or ongoing wounding in the developmental life cycle and prior and current relationships. In the healing journey, bridges from suffering are developed to healing resources/skills and connections to helpers outside themselves. These bridges often evolve in fits and starts and involve persistence and developing a sense of safety and trust. From the iteration between suffering and developing resources and connections, a new state emerges that involves hope, self-acceptance and helping others. Over time, this leads to healing that includes a sense of integrity and flourishing in the pursuit of meaningful goals and purpose.

Links between ecosystem health and human health and well-being are increasingly recognized with ever more awareness of impending environmental catastrophe. There is a need for reciprocal healing on multiple scales. Transdisciplinary teams have the potential to address complex socioecological problems, yet they also have inherent challenges. There is a need for new ways of working. This paper details a collaborative and emergent process undertaken to address these challenges. The methods - a combination of established and novel techniques - are important for facilitating transdisciplinary team development and eliciting commitment to shared work. As an example, we share a case study of team building including exploration of literature about environment and health that will inform future work within a multiphase project, Women's Dreams. Grounded in an emergent strategy approach that values addressing complex changes through relatively small interactions, our process incorporated six methods: individual mind mapping, bibliomancy, group processing using sticky notes and paper, group mind mapping, free writing, and synthetic reflection. Emergent themes included healing, story-culture, encountering nature, place, invitation, re-membering, and gathering together. Recurring concepts running through these themes focused on dis-ease, relationship, ways of being, wild wisdom, and reimagining the future.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Engagement with nature is an important part of many people’s lives, and the health and wellbeing benefits of nature–based activities are becoming increasingly recognised across disciplines from city planning to medicine. Despite this, urbanisation, challenges of modern life and environmental degradation are leading to a reduction in both the quantity and the quality of nature experiences. Nature–based health interventions (NBIs) can facilitate behavioural change through a somewhat structured promotion of nature–based experiences and, in doing so, promote improved physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. We conducted a Delphi expert elicitation process with 19 experts from seven countries (all named authors on this paper) to identify the different forms that such interventions take, the potential health outcomes and the target beneficiaries. In total, 27 NBIs were identified, aiming to prevent illness, promote wellbeing and treat specific physical, mental or social health and wellbeing conditions. These interventions were broadly categorized into those that change the environment in which people live, work, learn, recreate or heal (for example, the provision of gardens in hospitals or parks in cities) and those that change behaviour (for example, engaging people through organized programmes or other activities). We also noted the range of factors (such as socioeconomic variation) that will inevitably influence the extent to which these interventions succeed.

However, while evidence of the contributions of nature to human health is rapidly building, research into how biodiversity relates to human health remains limited in important respects. In particular, a better mechanistic understanding of the range of pathways through which biodiversity can influence human health is needed. These pathways relate to both psychological and social processes as well as biophysical processes. Building on evidence from across the natural, social and health sciences, we present a conceptual framework organizing the pathways linking biodiversity to human health. Four domains of pathways—both beneficial as well as harmful—link biodiversity with human health: (i) reducing harm (e.g. provision of medicines, decreasing exposure to air and noise pollution); (ii) restoring capacities (e.g. attention restoration, stress reduction); (iii) building capacities (e.g. promoting physical activity, transcendent experiences); and (iv) causing harm (e.g. dangerous wildlife, zoonotic diseases, allergens). We discuss how to test components of the biodiversity-health framework with available analytical approaches and existing datasets. In a world with accelerating declines in biodiversity, profound land-use change, and an increase in non-communicable and zoonotic diseases globally, greater understanding of these pathways can reinforce biodiversity conservation as a strategy for the promotion of health for both people and nature.

It triggered a profound shift in environmental awareness and the potential for human unity—inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the necessity of a “Great Transition”. While ambitious integrative efforts have never been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with advancing global urbanization in the digital age—for personal, environmental, economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting the inspiration of “Earthrise”, we welcome diverse perspectives from across all dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new normative values.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Physical distancing practices during the COVID-19 global pandemic contributed to a high degree of social isolation among older adults. To reduce loneliness and other ill effects of social isolation, public health experts recommended outdoor social gathering, with physical distancing. Adopting a case study approach, we explored how social aspects of group outdoor health walks (GOHWs) mitigate social isolation for older adults and improve individual social wellbeing. We used semi-structured interviews to understand the experiences of social isolation and social relationships in nine older (50–80 s) adults participating in a GOHW in Scotland, United Kingdom (UK). Verbatim transcripts were analysed through an iterative process of thematic analysis carried out by an interdisciplinary team of qualitative researchers from environmental psychology, medicine, and geography. Themes provide insight into the social dimensions of GOHWs, the mediating effects of social experiences, and the contribution these make to individual social wellbeing. GOHWs provide opportunities to be part of a group and attend to the needs of inexperienced or physically challenged individuals. Being part of the group walk fosters casual interpersonal interactions through spontaneous mixing during and after the walk. This programmatic structure counters loneliness, en-genders pleasurable anticipation of regular contact with others, supports physical activity, and fosters group cohesion.

We examined associations between recreational nature contact in the last seven days and self-reported health and well-being. Participants (n = 19,806) were drawn from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment Survey (2014/15–2015/16); weighted to be nationally representative. Weekly contact was categorised using 60 min blocks. Analyses controlled for residential greenspace and other neighbourhood and individual factors. Compared to no nature contact last week, the likelihood of reporting good health or high well-being became significantly greater with contact ≥120 mins (e.g. 120–179 mins: ORs [95%CIs]: Health = 1.59 [1.31–1.92]; Well-being = 1.23 [1.08–1.40]). Positive associations peaked between 200–300 mins per week with no further gain. The pattern was consistent across key groups including older adults and those with long-term health issues. It did not matter how 120 mins of contact a week was achieved (e.g. one long vs. several shorter visits/week).

Nature-deficit disorder, a journalistic term proposed to describe the ill effects of people’s alienation from nature, is not yet formally recognized as a medical diagnosis. However, over the past decade, the phrase has been enthusiastically taken up by some segments of the lay public. Social media, such as Twitter, with its opportunities to gather “big data” related to public opinions, offers a medium for exploring the discourse and dissemination around nature-deficit disorder and other nature–health concepts. In this paper, we report our experience of collecting more than 175,000 tweets, applying sentiment analysis to measure positive, neutral or negative feelings, and preliminarily mapping the impact on dissemination. Sentiment analysis is currently used to investigate the repercussions of events in social networks, scrutinize opinions about products and services, and understand various aspects of the communication in Web-based communities. Based on a comparison of nature-deficit-disorder “hashtags” and more generic nature hashtags, we make recommendations for the better dissemination of public health messages through changes to the framing of messages. We show the potential of Twitter to aid in better understanding the impact of the natural environment on human health and wellbeing.",10.3390/ijerph13010142,Robert Gordon University,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,

Sara L. Warber,Transformational Changes in Health Status: A Qualitative Exploration of Healing Moments,2017.0,Explore,Article,connectivity; healing; transformational change; connectivity; healing; transformational change,"2017 Elsevier Inc.Background and Aims Dramatic self-change is a familiar concept within religious experience and is recognized within psychotherapy and some fields of nursing. However, it has been given limited consideration in wider health research, including healing research. We sought to explore the phenomenon of “healing moments”. Methods Alternative medicine practitioners attending a continuing professional development course for healers within the UK's Holistic Health Show were shown a 10 min video clip showing two of the authors discussing healing moments. Sixty-nine (69) of the practitioners then provided “short stories” outlining their own experiences of such moments. Both the video and the short stories were analyzed qualitatively using a thematic approach. We sought to evaluate holistic practitioners’ perceptions of the concept of healing moments. Results The concept of healing moments was widely accepted by the 69 participants. An overarching theme of transformational change described personal shifts that ranged from the sudden and quasimiraculous to transient but much-needed improvements in health and wellbeing. Three subordinate themes of connectivity, quiescence and control were identified. Connectivity described intense connections, experienced through touch, empathy and love, which could provide reciprocal benefits for healers as well as clients. Quiescence captured the quiet, calm atmosphere that pervaded many healing episodes. The contrasting aspects of control encompassed healers relinquishing control to channel healing, and clients seizing control to become empowered in their own healing process. Conclusion Healing moments are a recognized and distinct concept within healing, although they remain under-explored in the literature. Our findings suggest that such experiences are common among alternative medicine practitioners. The concepts we uncovered can inform future research.",10.1016/j.explore.2017.06.005,University of Exeter Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,
Sara L. Warber,Understanding public perceptions of healing: An arts-based qualitative study,2019.0,Complementary Therapies in Medicine,Article,Creative methods; Healing; Public views; Qualitative research; Creative methods; Healing; Public views; Qualitative research,"2019 Elsevier LtdBackground: Most healing research has focussed on the views of healers, complementary and alternative medical (CAM)practitioners or medical professionals, and little is known about how the general public conceives of healing. Because healing is a complex and often abstract concept, we addressed this gap in the knowledge using creative qualitative approaches with members of the public. We aimed to elucidate the views of members of the public about their healing, to help offer a better understanding to healthcare professionals. Methods: Our qualitative arts-based drawing method invited people to respond using crayons and paper to the question ‘What does the word healing mean to you?’ These drawings were followed by a short recorded interview in which people explained their image. We used convenience sampling to approach members of the public visiting a large wellbeing show and a museum. We analysed images and interviews in tandem using a focus on metaphor. Results: We interviewed 59 people, including three children. Almost two thirds of participants were female. Participants’ images and interviews documented three main models of the healing process: i)Healing comes from a great external force, exemplified by the sun; ii)Healing comes from other people, whether medical professionals, CAM practitioners or healers; and iii)Healing comes from within, and the individual has the ability to self-heal. People described practices and inner states that could help achieve healing. Some people depicted more than one model, demonstrating the interlinkages between the models, and some described the outcome of healing (wholeness)rather than the process. Conclusions: The drawing-based approach encouraged an intuitive way of thinking, capturing concepts that cannot easily be verbalised. Members of the public have nuanced, complex understandings of the concept of healing, and these echo historical and modern concepts of healing and healthcare. The models our participants described often interlink, suggesting an overarching framework for the way people conceive of healing. The findings may be useful both as a guide to further research and as insight that may facilitate healthcare processes.",10.1016/j.ctim.2019.05.013,University of Exeter Medical School,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,
Sara L. Warber,"What approaches to social prescribing work, for whom, and in what circumstances? A protocol for a realist review",2016.0,Systematic Reviews,Article,Community referral; Mental health; Primary care; Realist review; Social prescribing; Community referral; Mental health; Primary care; Realist review; Social prescribing,"2016 The Author(s).Background: The use of non-drug, non-health-service interventions has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative to help those with long-term conditions manage their illness and improve their health and well-being. Interventions typically involve accessing activities run by the third sector or community agencies and may also be described as non-medical referral, community referral or social prescribing. To be effective, patients need to be ""transferred"" from the primary care setting into the community and to maintain their participation in activities. However, it is not currently known how and why these approaches enable which people under what circumstances to reach community services that may benefit their health and well-being. Methods: Database searches and extensive searching of grey sources will be carried out in an attempt to find evidence associated with referral and retention in social prescribing. After initial scoping searches, two main phases of searching will be conducted: (a) will focus on the identification of programme theories to illustrate how approaches to social prescribing work for different people and in different contexts and (b) will consist of targeted searches to locate evidence to refine these candidate theories into configurations of the contexts in which populations and the main mechanisms outcomes are achieved. Inclusion criteria will initially be broad in order to develop a clear picture of the ways in which social prescriptions might operate but may iteratively become more focused in response to initially identified evidence, for example, in terms of the population group. An expert advisory group consisting of professionals working in a range of organisations involved in social prescribing will be convened to check the approaches in the review and provide real-life experience of social prescribing. Findings from the review will be disseminated to commissioners, published in a peer-reviewed journal and used to help refine an intervention model for an outdoor nature-based group intervention. Discussion: This realist review will explore why mechanisms of social prescribing work, for what groups of people and their impact on enrolment, attendance and adherence to programmes. The use of realist approaches to detail the social prescribing process is novel and will offer insights into effective transfer of patients.

A Discussion on Paradigms and Clinical Research Strategies,2019.0,Complementary Medicine Research,Review,Biomarkers; Complementary and alternative medicine; Complex interventions; Integrative medicine; Traditional medicine; Trial methodology; Whole medical systems; Biomarkers; Complementary and alternative medicine; Complex interventions; Integrative medicine; Traditional medicine; Trial methodology; Whole medical systems; Ear; Research,"2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: Research in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encounters a variety of challenges, such as potentially synergistic, multimodal, and complex interventions which are often dependent on the relationship between practitioner and patient, on specific settings, and on patients' individual preferences, expectations, beliefs, and motivations. Moreover, patients seeking CAM care often suffer from chronic disease conditions, and multiple symptoms and/or pathologies. On the other hand, CAM interventions are often challenged as being solely dependent on subjective and nonspecific factors without biologically based mechanisms of action. If we agree that biomarkers as outcomes are important for the understanding of CAM interventions, a hypothesis- and strategy-driven process for the selection of the most appropriate biomarkers is needed. Methods: This paper presents the results of an expert panel on how to integrate biomarkers in whole system research of an interdisciplinary workshop on research methodology in CAM held in November 2012. Results: The following main CAM research challenges were identified: (a) finding appropriate biomarkers, which are able to picture the complex pathophysiological pathways and likewise complex interventions under study; (b) integrating these biomarkers into clinical trials in CAM; and (c) identifying the biomarkers specific to the particular CAM intervention being applied. Conclusion: The paper provides a disease/condition/symptom- and intervention-driven strategy regarding how to identify the outcomes of interest and possible related biomarkers. The research approach presented here allows the selected biomarkers to be grounded in conventional physiology/pathophysiology as well as complementary and alternative concepts, including traditional systems of medicine. The goal is to provide researchers in the field with a framework on how to integrate biomarkers into complex trials.",10.1159/000498981,UiT Norges Arktiske Universitet,0000-0001-6917-4154,6602106224.0,51961243.0

Data come from the Detroit Metro Area Community Study, a population-based study conducted July 15–20, 2020. Participants were asked whether they would get a new COVID-19 vaccine after being randomly assigned information about the vaccine’s effectiveness (50% or 95%) and chance of fever (5% or 20%). Among 1,117 Detroiters, 51.3% would accept a COVID-19 vaccine that is 50% effective and 77.1% would accept a vaccine that is 95% effective. Women and adults ≥65 were more accepting of a vaccine; Black Detroiters were less accepting. Believing vaccines to be important, effective, and safe was associated with higher acceptance. Uptake of a COVID-19 may be limited, depending on perceived vaccine effectiveness and general attitudes toward vaccines.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Governments, public health officials and pharmaceutical companies have all mobilized resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, social distancing, and personal protective behaviours have been helpful but have shut down economies and disrupted normal activities. Vaccinations protect populations from COVID-19 and allow a return to pre-pandemic ways of living. However, vaccine development, distribution and promotion have not been sufficient to ensure maximum vaccine uptake. Vaccination is an individual choice and requires acceptance of the need to be vaccinated in light of any risks. This paper presents a behavioural sciences framework to promote vaccine acceptance by addressing the complex and ever evolving landscape of COVID-19. Effective promotion of vaccine uptake requires understanding the context-specific barriers to acceptance. We present the AACTT framework (Action, Actor, Context, Target, Time) to identify the action needed to be taken, the person needed to act, the context for the action, as well as the target of the action within a timeframe. Once identified a model for identifying and overcoming barriers, called COM-B (Capability, Opportunity and Motivation lead to Behaviour), is presented. This analysis identifies issues associated with capability, opportunity and motivation to act. These frameworks can be used to facilitate action that is fluid and involves policy makers, organisational leaders as well as citizens and families.",10.3390/vaccines10010007,"Dalhousie University, Faculty of Medicine",0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The success of large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaigns is contingent upon people being willing to receive the vaccine. Our study explored COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its correlates in eight different countries around the globe. We analyzed convenience sample data collected between March 2020 and January 2021 as part of the iCARE cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the correlates of vaccine hesitancy. We included 32,028 participants from eight countries, and observed that 27% of the participants exhibited vaccine hesitancy, with increases over time. France reported the highest level of hesitancy (47.3%) and Brazil reported the lowest (9.6%). Women, younger individuals (≤29 years), people living in rural areas, and those with a lower perceived income were more likely to be hesitant. People who previously received an influenza vaccine were 70% less likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We observed that people reporting greater COVID-19 health concerns were less likely to be hesitant, whereas people with higher personal financial concerns were more likely to be hesitant. Our findings indicate that there is substantial vaccine hesitancy in several countries, with cross-national differences in the magnitude and direction of the trend. Vaccination communication initiatives should target hesitant individuals (women, younger adults, people with lower incomes and those living in rural areas), and should highlight the immediate health, social and economic benefits of vaccination across these settings. Country-level analyses are warranted to understand the complex psychological, socio-environmental, and cultural factors associated with vaccine hesitancy.",10.3390/vaccines9060661,Montreal Behavioural Medicine Centre,0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,

We aim to describe the prevalence and predictors of HPV vaccination initiation among males of White, Black, and Middle-Eastern/North-African (MENA) descent in southeast Michigan. Methods: We conducted three community-based surveys in 2019 that provided primary data via self report. Using population weights and multivariate modeling, we measured the prevalence and predictors of HPV vaccine initiation in each race/ethnicity of men (age 18–34 years) analyzed. Results: The vaccine initiation rates were 44.5 % (95 % CI: 44.4, 44.6) for White men, 46.2 % (46.0, 46.4) for Black men, and 23.2 % (22.8, 23.6) for MENA men, (p < 0.001). Being a student, compared to unemployed or disabled, was significantly associated with HPV vaccine initiation across all three races/ethnicities. Married men of any race/ethnicity were unlikely to be vaccinated. MENA men born in the US and having some college education were also more likely to initiate HPV vaccination.

To identify the behavioural components of HPV-vaccine hesitancy in females aged 15 and under and their families, we conducted a convergent mixed-methods study in which 196 parents/caregivers responded to an online questionnaire and 10 focus groups were held with 13 of these parents/caregivers, and 50 age-eligible girls. The study is novel as it is the first to explore the factors influencing HPV-vaccine hesitancy alongside the COVID vaccine within an integrative model of behaviour change, the capability-opportunity-motivation-behaviour (COM-B) model. We found that COVID-19 has had an impact on the awareness of HPV and HPV vaccination. Lack of information about the vaccination programs, concerns about vaccine safety and the relationship between HPV and sexuality could be related to vaccine hesitancy.

While there are many empirical and conceptual approaches to measuring and improving care coordination, use of theory is limited by its complexity and the wide variability of available frameworks. We systematically identified and categorized existing care coordination theoretical frameworks in new ways to make the theory-to-practice link more accessible. Methods: To identify relevant frameworks, we searched MEDLINE®, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SocINDEX from 2010 to May 2018, and various other nonbibliographic sources. We summarized framework characteristics and organized them using categories from the Sustainable intEgrated chronic care modeLs for multi-morbidity: delivery, FInancing, and performancE (SELFIE) framework. Based on expert input, we then categorized available frameworks on consideration of whether they addressed contextual factors, what locus they addressed, and their design elements. We used predefined criteria for study selection and data abstraction. Results: Among 4389 citations, we identified 37 widely diverse frameworks, including 16 recent frameworks unidentified by previous reviews. Few led to development of measures (39%) or initiatives (6%). We identified 5 that are most relevant to primary care. The 2018 framework by Weaver et al., describing relationships between a wide range of primary care-specific domains, may be the most useful to those investigating the effectiveness of primary care coordination approaches. We also identified 3 frameworks focused on locus and design features of implementation that could prove especially useful to those responsible for implementing care coordination. Discussion: This review identified the most comprehensive frameworks and their main emphases for several general practice-relevant applications. Greater application of these frameworks in the design and evaluation of coordination approaches may increase their consistent implementation and measurement. Future research should emphasize implementation-focused frameworks that better identify factors and mechanisms through which an initiative achieves impact.",10.1007/s11606-019-04966-z,Portland VA Medical Center,0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,

We begin with a theoretical overview and introduction to the dynamics that underlie sampling bias. We then empirically examine sampling bias in online COVID-19 surveys and evaluate the degree to which common statistical adjustments for demographic covariates successfully attenuate such bias. This registered study analysed responses to identical questions from three convenience and three largely representative samples (total N = 13,731) collected online in Canada within the International COVID-19 Awareness and Responses Evaluation Study (www.icarestudy.com). We compared samples on 11 behavioural and psychological outcomes (e.g., adherence to COVID-19 prevention measures, vaccine intentions) across three time points and employed multiverse-style analyses to examine how 512 combinations of demographic covariates (e.g., sex, age, education, income, ethnicity) impacted sampling discrepancies on these outcomes. Significant discrepancies emerged between samples on 73% of outcomes. Participants in the convenience samples held more positive thoughts towards and engaged in more COVID-19 prevention behaviours. Covariates attenuated sampling differences in only 55% of cases and increased differences in 45%. No covariate performed reliably well. Our results suggest that online convenience samples may display more positive dispositions towards COVID-19 prevention behaviours being studied than would samples drawn using more representative means. Adjusting results for demographic covariates frequently increased rather than decreased bias, suggesting that researchers should be cautious when interpreting adjusted findings. Using multiverse-style analyses as extended sensitivity analyses is recommended.",10.1007/s10654-022-00932-y,Montreal Behavioural Medicine Centre,0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,

The objective is to learn from relevant theory-based literature about fit between intervention options and coordination needs, thereby bringing insights from theory to enhance intervention design, implementation, and troubleshooting. To take this idea from an abstract notion to tangible application, our workgroup on models and measures from the Veterans Health Administration (VA) State of the Art (SOTA) conference on care coordination first summarizes our distillation of care coordination theoretical frameworks (models) into three common conceptual domains—context of an intervention, locus in which an intervention is applied, and specific design features of the intervention.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Despite their disparate rates of infection and mortality, many communities of color report high levels of vaccine hesitancy. This paper describes racial differences in COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Detroit, and assesses, using a mediation model, how individuals’ personal experiences with COVID-19 and trust in authorities mediate racial disparities in vaccination acceptance. The Detroit Metro Area Communities Study (DMACS) is a panel survey of a representative sample of Detroit residents. There were 1012 respondents in the October 2020 wave, of which 856 (83%) were followed up in June 2021. We model the impact of race and ethnicity on vaccination uptake using multivariable logistic regression, and report mediation through direct experiences with COVID as well as trust in government and in healthcare providers. Within Detroit, only 58% of Non-Hispanic (NH) Black residents were vaccinated, compared to 82% of Non-Hispanic white Detroiters, 50% of Hispanic Detroiters, and 52% of other racial/ethnic groups. Trust in healthcare providers and experiences with friends and family dying from COVID-19 varied significantly by race/ethnicity. The mediation analysis reveals that 23% of the differences in vaccine uptake by race could be eliminated if NH Black Detroiters were to have levels of trust in healthcare providers similar to those among NH white Detroiters. Our analyses suggest that efforts to improve relationships among healthcare providers and NH Black communities in Detroit are critical to overcoming local COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Increased study of and intervention in these communities is critical to building trust and managing widespread health crises.",10.3390/vaccines10010036,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,15131888.0

All rights reserved.Objective: To slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, many countries have instituted preventive approaches (masks, social distancing) as well as the distribution of vaccines. Adherence to these preventive measures is crucial to the success of controlling the pandemic but decreased perceptions of disease severity could limit adherence. The aim of our study was to observe changes in perceived personal severity and perceived community severity; the study also explored their predictors. Method: In a longitudinal study from an address-based probability survey in Detroit, we asked participants to rate their perceived severity of COVID-19 for themselves and for their community. In our analysis, 746 participants were queried across 5 waves of the Detroit Metro Area Communities Study surveys from March 31 to October 27 in 2020. We tested for trends in changes of self-reported perceived severity for themselves and for their community; we assessed the effects of different predictors of the two severities through mixed effects logistic regression models. Results: Our results highlight that the overall levels of perceived community and personal severity were decreasing over time even though both severities were fluctuating with rising confirmed case counts. Compared with non-Hispanic (NH) White Detroiters, NH Black Detroiters reported a higher perceived personal severity (OR: 5.30, 95% CI: 2.97, 9.47) but both groups reported similar levels of perceived community severity. We found steeper declines in perceived severity in NH White than NH Black Detroiters over time; the impact of education and income on perceived severity was attenuated in NH Black Detroiters compared with NH White Detroiters. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that perceived severity for COVID-19 decreased through time and was affected by different factors among varied racial/ethnic groups. Future interventions to slow the pace of the pandemic should take into account perceived personal and community severities among varied ethnic/racial subgroups.",10.18865/ED.32.3.231,University of Florida College of Medicine,0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,

The primary aim of our work was to evaluate the degree to which populations were accepting of home-based screenings for colorectal cancer (CRC) and cervical cancer (primary HPV testing). Three groups of adults having distinct health burdens which may affect acceptance of home-based cancer screening were identified through outpatient electronic medical records as follows as either having survived a COVID hospitalization, having been positive for non-COVID respiratory illness or having type 2 diabetes. 132 respondents (58% female) completed an online survey with hypothetical cases about their acceptance of home-based CRC or cervical cancer screening. Among females, urine and vaginal screening for primary HPV testing was acceptable to 64% and 59%, respectively. Among both males and females, CRC home screening with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or Cologuard was acceptable to 60% of the respondents.

The aim of this study was to determine the rates and predictors of cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for women 50–65 years of three race/ethnicities. White, black and MENA women of Southeast Michigan were surveyed once in 2019 for demographics, health care barriers, chronic diseases, and cancer screening updates using in-person, telephone, and online methods. Descriptive statistics and multivariate multinomial logistic regression were used to predict up-to-date colorectal cancer and cervical cancer screening. All analyses were adjusted by local population weights for comparability and generalizability. 394 women participated with 54% up-to-date on both screenings, 21% for cervical cancer screening alone, and 12% for CRC alone. Women more likely to be up-to-date for only cervical cancer screening compared to both cancer screens are younger (aOR 0.83 (95% CI 0.76, 0.92), are of MENA descent (7.97 (2.46, 25.76) and have no insurance (9.41 (1.07, 82.92).

All rights reserved.Cancer continues to be the second most common cause of death in the United States. Racially and ethnically minoritized populations continue to experience disparities in cancer prevention compared with majority populations. Multilevel interventions-from policy, communities, health care institutions, clinical teams, families, and individuals-may be uniquely suited to reducing health disparities through behavioral risk factor modification in these populations. The aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the evidence for primary prevention among racially and ethnically minoritized subpopulations in the United States. We focus on the epidemiology of tobacco use, obesity, diet and physical activity, alcohol use, sun exposure, and smoking, as well as increasing uptake of the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV), as mutable behavioral risk factors. We describe interventions at the policy level, including raising excise taxes on tobacco products; within communities and with community partners, for safe greenways and parks, and local healthful food; health care institutions, with reminder systems for HPV vaccinations; among clinicians, by screening for alcohol use and providing tailored weight reduction approaches; families, with HPV education; and among individuals, routinely using sun protection.

Only one-third of individuals with T2D receive care as recommended by the American Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines. Effective strategies are needed to accelerate the implementation of guideline concordant T2D care. Methods: The Michigan Collaborative for Type 2 Diabetes (MCT2D) is a statewide population health collaborative quality initiative (CQI) developed to improve the care of all people with T2D in Michigan. MCT2D has developed a learning health system with physician organizations and their constituent practices to support quality improvement initiatives focused on (1) improving use of guideline-directed pharmacotherapy to improve cardiorenal outcomes, (2) increasing evidence-based use of continuous glucose monitoring, and (3) supporting use of lower carbohydrate eating patterns. Results: Between 2021 and 2022, MCT2D recruited 28 of the 40 Michigan-based physician organizations participating in Blue Cross’ Physician Group Incentive Program with 336 constituent practices and 1357 physicians in primary care (304), endocrinology (21) and nephrology (11). In January 2022, baseline data included a sample of 96,140 unique individuals with T2D. The baseline HbA1c was ≤ 7.0% for 66.3% of patients (n = 32,787), while 14.9% of patients had a most recent HbA1c ≥ 8.0% (n = 7,393). The most recent body mass index (BMI) was ≥ 30.0 for 64.8% of patients (n = 38,516). Discussion: MCT2D has organized a statewide collaborative to recruit and engage a diverse and large set of physician organizations and their constituent practices. This is a promising opportunity to accelerate adoption of guideline-concordant care for people with T2D and may be a model for other state or regional collaboratives. Future directions include specific evidence-based interventions targeted at reducing diabetes-linked comorbidities and associated healthcare costs as well as strategies focused on T2D prevention among at-risk populations.",10.1186/s12913-024-11520-z,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-5346-0997,7006171579.0,

Design Five sequential cross-sectional age, sex and province-weighted population-based samples who completed online surveys. Setting Canada. Participants A total of 15 019 Canadians aged 18 years and over were recruited through a recognised polling firm (Leger Opinion). Respondents were 51.5% female with a mean age of 48.1 (SD 17.2) years (range 18-95 years) and predominantly white (80.8%). Primary and secondary outcome measures Rates of vaccine hesitancy over the five surveys (time points) and their sociodemographic, clinical and psychological correlates. Results A total of 42.2% of respondents reported some degree of vaccine hesitancy, which was lowest during surveys 1 (April 2020) and 5 (March 2021) and highest during survey 3 (November 2020). Fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women, those aged 50 and younger, non-white, those with high school education or less, and those with annual household incomes below the poverty line in Canada were significantly more likely to report vaccine hesitancy, as were essential and healthcare workers, parents of children under the age of 18 and those who do not get regular influenza vaccines. Endorsing prevention behaviours as important for reducing virus transmission and high COVID-19 health concerns were associated with 77% and 54% reduction in vaccine hesitancy, respectively. Having high personal financial concerns was associated with 1.33 times increased odds of vaccine hesitancy.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The overall goal of this study was to determine whether Aquamin®, a calcium-, magne-sium-, trace element-rich, red algae-derived natural product, would alter the expression of proteins involved in growth-regulation and differentiation in colon. Thirty healthy human subjects (at risk for colorectal cancer) were enrolled in a three-arm, 90-day interventional trial. Aquamin® was compared to calcium alone and placebo. Before and after the interventional period, colonic biopsies were obtained. Biopsies were evaluated by immunohistology for expression of Ki67 (proliferation marker) and for CK20 and p21 (differentiation markers). Tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry-based detection was used to assess levels of multiple proteins. As compared to placebo or calcium, Aquamin® reduced the level of Ki67 expression and slightly increased CK20 expression. Increased p21 expression was observed with both calcium and Aquamin®. In proteomic screen, Aquamin® treatment resulted in many more proteins being upregulated (including pro-apoptotic, cy-tokeratins, cell–cell adhesion molecules, and components of the basement membrane) or downreg-ulated (proliferation and nucleic acid metabolism) than placebo. Calcium alone also altered the expression of many of the same proteins but not to the same extent as Aquamin®. We conclude that daily Aquamin® ingestion alters protein expression profile in the colon that could be beneficial to colonic health.",10.3390/nu13030939,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Long-term, persistent cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most common side effect reported by lymphoma survivors. CRF reduces quality of life, and treatments are limited. This pilot study aimed to determine feasibility of recruiting and retaining diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors in a 12-week remote Fatigue Reduction Diet (FRD) intervention and evaluate preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Participants met remotely with a registered dietitian nutritionist for eight individual sessions. FRD goals included consuming specific fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acid rich foods. Acceptability was assessed by session attendance, FRD goal attainment, and exit surveys. Self-reported dietary intake and fatigue were measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 and PROMIS Fatigue Short Form, respectively, at baseline and post-intervention. Ten DLBCL survivors enrolled; nine attended all sessions and completed the intervention. Weekly adherence to targeted food intake goals improved significantly throughout the study (all p < 0.05), with participants meeting goals over 4 day per week by week 11. Mean[SD] diet quality improved significantly from baseline (65.9[6.3]) to post-intervention (82.2[5.0], p < 0.001). Mean[SD] fatigue reduced significantly from baseline (50.41[9.18]) to post-intervention (45.79[6.97], p < 0.05).

We investigated factors associated with access and cost-related nonadherence to prescriptions in a population-based cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and controls. Methods: Detailed sociodemographic and prescription data were collected by structured interview in 2014–2015 from participants in the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) cohort. We compared access between cases and frequency-matched controls and examined associated factors in separate multivariable logistic regression models. Results: A total of 654 participants (462 SLE patients, 192 controls) completed the baseline visit; 584 (89%) were female, 285 (44%) were Black, and the mean age was 53 years. SLE patients and controls reported similar frequencies of being unable to access prescribed medications (12.1% versus 9.4%, respectively; P was not significant). SLE patients were twice as likely as controls to report cost-related prescription nonadherence in the preceding 12 months to save money (21.7% versus 10.4%; P = 0.001) but were also more likely to ask their doctor for lower cost alternatives (23.8% versus 15.6%; P = 0.02). Disparities were found in association with income, race, and health insurance status, but the main findings persisted after adjusting for these and other variables in multivariable models. Conclusion: SLE patients were more likely than controls from the general population to report cost-related prescription nonadherence, including skipping doses, taking less medicine, and delaying filling prescriptions; yet, <1 in 4 patients asked providers for lower cost medications. Consideration of medication costs in patient decision-making could provide a meaningful avenue for improving access and adherence to medications.",10.1002/acr.24397,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,
Suzanna Zick,Acupressure for cancer-fatigue in ovarian cancer survivor (The AcuOva Study): A community-based clinical trial study protocol examining the impact of self-acupressure on persistent cancer related fatigue in ovarian cancer survivors,2021.0,Contemporary Clinical Trials,Article,Acupressure; Cancer survivor; Cancer-related fatigue; Ovarian cancer; Quality of life; Sleep disturbances; Acupressure; Cancer survivor; Cancer-related fatigue; Ovarian cancer; Quality of life; Sleep disturbances,"2021 Elsevier Inc.Background Persistent cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common and burdensome symptoms experienced by ovarian cancer survivors. Despite the high burden of fatigue in ovarian cancer survivors, there are few available treatments. Previous research has shown self-acupressure to be a safe method for improving persistent fatigue, sleep, and quality of life among fatigued breast cancer survivors, yet there are no studies examining self-acupressure for fatigue in ovarian cancer survivors. Methods A three group parallel, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of self-acupressure taught and delivered via a patient-designed, custom-built mobile app (“MeTime”) and accompanying hand-held device (“AcuWand”) to help guide correct pressure application. A sample of 165 ovarian cancer survivors, who have completed primary cancer treatment will be recruited from tumor registries in Michigan and Los Angeles. Participants will be mailed a tablet preloaded with the app and a device, and all visits will be conducted remotely. Participants will be randomized to 6-weeks of daily self-acupressure via the app and device, or a sham app and device, or no care group. Self-report measures will be completed at baseline, 6-weeks (post-intervention), 3-, and 6-months. Primary outcome is the Brief Fatigue Inventory; secondary outcomes are sleep, quality of life, and symptoms commonly associated with persistent fatigue. Discussion An app based self-acupressure treatment may be an easily-accessible and inexpensive treatment to reduce fatigue in ovarian cancer survivors. The results of the study will provide information on the possible benefits of app-based self-acupressure for fatigue in ovarian cancer survivors.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine differences in diet quality and macronutrients for cancer survivors with and without CIPN. Cancer survivors (e.g., ≥3 months post platinum and/or taxane-based neurotoxic chemotherapy) with (i.e., ≥1/4 PRO-CTACE™ Numbness and Tingling Severity) and without CIPN completed the VioScreen Research Graphical Food Frequency Questionnaire. The association among diet (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]), macronutrient intake (average percent caloric intake), and CIPN severity were analyzed using generalized linear regression models, adjusting for caloric intake, body mass index, age, and sex. Results revealed that for each one-point increase in diet quality, PRO-CTCAE severity decreased by −0.06 (95% CI: −0.10, −0.02, P < 0.01).

All rights reserved.Introduction: Chronic spinal pain is disabling and has high personal and societal costs. Risk factors include behavioral factors; however, little is known about the role of diet quality and its association with spinal pain. Higher diet quality and consumption of macronutrients that drive higher diet quality were hypothesized to be associated with lower odds of having spinal pain. Methods: An analysis of a population-based data set (NHANES cycle 2009-2010) was conducted. Diet quality was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (score 0-100). To examine odds of pain related to dietary intake, generalized linear regressions were used adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: Of 4123 participants (mean age 43.560.44 [SD], 2167 [52.6%] female), 800 (19.4%) reported chronic spinal pain. People with chronic spinal pain consumed similar amounts of calories to those with no spinal pain (2137644.5 vs 2159.9627.7), but had significantly poorer diet quality compared to people without spinal pain (51.9760.65 vs 54.3160.39, P50.007). From multivariate analyses, individuals with diet quality in the highest tertile on Healthy Eating Index-2015 were 24% less likely to report chronic spinal pain relative to those in the lowest tertile. Higher fruit, whole grain, and dairy intake were associated with 20% to 26% lower likelihood (all P for trend ,0.028) of chronic spinal pain.

We compared methylation of the B cell costimulatory CD70 gene, in persons with lupus and controls, and characterized associations with age. Results: In 297 adults with SLE and 92 controls from the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort, average CD70 methylation of CD4+ T cell DNA across 10 CpG sites based on pyrosequencing of the promoter region was higher for persons with SLE compared to controls, accounting for covariates [β = 2.3, p = 0.011]. Using Infinium MethylationEPIC array data at 18 CD70-annoted loci (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell DNA), sites within the promoter region tended to be hypomethylated in SLE, while those within the gene region were hypermethylated. In SLE but not controls, age was significantly associated with pyrosequencing-based CD70 methylation: for every year increase in age, methylation increased by 0.14 percentage points in SLE, accounting for covariates. Also within SLE, CD70 methylation approached a significantly higher level in Black persons compared to White persons (β = 1.8, p = 0.051). Conclusions: We describe altered CD70 methylation patterns in T lymphocyte subsets in adults with SLE relative to controls, and report associations particular to SLE between methylation of this immune-relevant gene and both age and race, possibly a consequence of “weathering” or accelerated aging which may have implications for SLE pathogenesis and potential intervention strategies.",10.1016/j.jaut.2023.103137,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

We investigated whether cost-related non-adherence (CRNA) to prescription medications was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes in a population-based systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort. Methods: Sociodemographic and prescription data were collected by structured interviews in 2014–2015 from patients meeting SLE criteria in the established Michigan Lupus Epidemiology & Surveillance (MILES) Cohort. We examined the associations between CRNA and potential confounders such as sociodemographics and health insurance coverage, and outcome measures of SLE activity and damage using multivariable linear regression. Results: 462 SLE participants completed the study visit: 430 (93.1%) female, 208 (45%) Black, and mean age 53.3 years. 100 (21.6%) participants with SLE reported CRNA in the preceding 12 months. After adjusting for covariates, CRNA was associated with both higher levels of current SLE disease activity [SLAQ: β coeff 2.7 (95% CI 1.3, 4.1), p < 0.001] and damage [LDIQ β coeff 1.4 (95% CI 0.5, 2.4), p = 0.003]. Race, health insurance status, and fulfilling Fibromyalgia (FM) Survey Criteria were independently associated with both higher (worse) SLAQ and LDIQ scores; female sex was further associated with higher SLAQ scores. Conclusion: Patients with SLE who reported CRNA in the previous 12 months had significantly worse self-reported current disease activity and damage scores compared to those not reporting CRNA. Raising awareness and addressing barriers or concerns related to financial implications and accessibility issues in care plans may help to improve these outcomes.",10.1177/09612033231186113,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

Arthritis Care & Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American College of RheumatologyObjective: To examine associations between dietary intake of omega-3 (n-3; generally antiinflammatory) and omega-6 (n-6; generally proinflammatory) fatty acids and patient-reported outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: This study was based on the population-based Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance cohort. Estimates of n-3 and n-6 intake were derived from Diet History Questionnaire II items (past year with portion size version). Patient-reported outcomes included self-reported lupus activity (Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire [SLAQ]). Multivariable regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, and body mass index, was used to assess associations between absolute intake of n-3 and n-6, as well as the n-6:n-3 ratio, and patient-reported outcomes. Results: Among 456 SLE cases, 425 (93.2%) were female, 207 (45.4%) were African American, and the mean ± SD age was 52.9 ± 12.3 years. Controlling for potential confounders, the average SLAQ score was significantly higher by 0.3 points (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.1, 0.6; P = 0.013) with each unit increase of the n-6:n-3 ratio. Both lupus activity and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance scores were lower with each 1-gram/1,000 kcal increase of n-3 fatty acids (SLAQ regression coefficient β = –0.8 [95% CI –1.6, 0.0]; P = 0.055; PROMIS sleep β = –1.1 [95% CI –2.0, –0.2]; P = 0.017). Higher n-3 intakes were nonsignificantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms and comorbid fibromyalgia, and with higher quality of life, whereas results for the n6:n3 ratio trended in the opposite direction. Conclusion: This population-based study suggests that higher dietary intake of n-3 fatty acids and lower n-6:n-3 ratios are favorably associated with patient-reported outcomes in SLE, particularly self-reported lupus activity and sleep quality.",10.1002/acr.23925,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

To ensure cancer patients receive effective, appropriate, and safe care, health professionals providing integrative cancer care should have a certain set of competencies. The aim of this project was to define core competencies for different health professions involved in integrative oncology. The project consisted of two phases. A systematic literature review on published competencies was performed, and the results informed an international and interprofessional consensus procedure. The second phase consisted of three rounds of consensus procedure and included 28 experts representing 7 different professions (medical doctors, psychologists, nurses, naturopathic doctors, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, yoga practitioners, patient navigators) as well as patient advocates, public health experts, and members of the Society for Integrative Oncology. A total of 40 integrative medicine competencies were identified in the literature review. These were further complemented by 18 core oncology competencies. The final round of the consensus procedure yielded 37 core competencies in the following categories: knowledge (n = 11), skills (n = 17), and abilities (n = 9). There was an agreement that these competencies are relevant for all participating professions. The integrative oncology core competencies combine both fundamental oncology knowledge and integrative medicine competencies that are necessary to provide effective and safe integrative oncology care for cancer patients. They can be used as a starting point for developing profession-specific learning objectives and to establish integrative oncology education and training programs to meet the needs of cancer patients and health professionals.",10.1007/s13187-020-01829-8,Berliner Institut für Gesundheitsforschung,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,5871911.0

Objective: Conduct a feasibility study of gentle yoga among elders in assisted and independent living. Design: Single arm pre/post clinical trial. Subjects: Adults (≥65 years of age) with self-identified chronic pain (≥3 on a 10-point scale, lasting for ≥3 months) and no current yoga practice. Intervention: Ten weekly 60-min gentle yoga classes tailored to elderly adults. Outcome measures: At baseline, weeks 5, 10 (end of intervention), and 20 (follow-up), we collected data on feasibility (adherence, retention, safety), pain, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and physical function. Results: Twenty-six participants enrolled (88% women, 77% white, 58% in assisted living) with average age of 86.6 ± 4.4 (Mean, STD). Twenty participants completed the intervention, with 90% adhering (completing ≥6 classes). Nine participants (45% of completers) experienced adverse events, which were non-serious and related to transient musculoskeletal pain. No adverse events resulted in study withdrawal. Participants reported being somewhat likely to recommend yoga to a friend, and quite a bit likely to do yoga again. At the end of the intervention, four of twenty participants reported practicing yoga outside of class. Anxiety significantly decreased from 5.80 (SE=0.90) to 4.44 (SE=0.74) (p = 0.014), but there were no changes in other measures.

We used baseline food frequency questionnaires to calculate dietary scores among 112,468 postmenopausal women in the Women’s Health Initiative. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for cancer risk estimation. Metabolomic profile scores were derived using elastic-net regression with leave-one-out cross validation. In over 17.8 years, 18,768 incident invasive cancers were adjudicated. Higher EDIH and EDIP scores were associated with greater total cancer risk, and higher HEI-2015 with lower risk: HRQ5vsQ1(95% CI): EDIH, 1.10 (1.04–1.15); EDIP, 1.08 (1.02–1.15); HEI-2015, 0.93 (0.89–0.98). The multivariable-adjusted incidence rate difference(Q5vsQ1) for total cancer was: +52 (EDIH), +41 (EDIP) and −49 (HEI-2015) per 100,000 person years. All three indices were associated with colorectal cancer, and EDIH and EDIP with endometrial and breast cancer risk. EDIH was further associated with luminal-B, ER-negative and triple negative breast cancer subtypes.

Oncology providers rarely receive training about dietary supplements. We evaluated whether e-learning modules could improve oncology providers’ dietary supplement knowledge. Oncology providers participated in the National Cancer Institute funded Integrative Oncology Scholars (IOS) program. We used posttest readiness assurance tests (RAT) to measure knowledge acquisition from modules. One cohort completed a pre and posttest RAT to assess change in knowledge. Multivariate linear regression models adjusted for gender, race, profession, and years in practice were used to determine if these characteristics were associated with posttest RAT performance and change in pre to posttest RAT scores. Scholars (N = 101) included 86% (N = 87) females; age 44 ± 10 years; 72% (N = 73) Non-Hispanic White; years in practice mean range 11–15 ± 10. There were 37 physicians, 11 physician assistants, 23 nurses, 21 social workers, 2 psychologists, 4 pharmacists, and 2 physical therapists. The posttest dietary supplement and antioxidant RAT scores for all Scholars were 67 ± 18% and 71 ± 14%.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A growing number of cancer patients use complementary and alternative therapies during and after conventional cancer treatment. Patients are often reluctant to discuss these therapies with their oncologist, and oncologists may have limited knowledge and confidence on how to advise patients on the appropriate use. Integrative oncology is a patient-centered, evidence-informed field that utilizes mind–body practices, lifestyle modifications and/or natural products interwoven with conventional cancer treatment. It prioritizes safety and best available evidence to offer appropriate interventions alongside conventional care. There are few opportunities for oncologists to learn about integrative oncology. In this commentary, we highlight the Integrative Oncology Scholars (IOS) program as a means to increase competency in this growing field. We provide an overview of several integrative oncology modalities that are taught through this program, including lifestyle modifications, physical activity, and mind–body interventions. We conclude that as more evidence is generated in this field, it will be essential that oncology healthcare providers are aware of the prevalent use of these modalities by their patients and cancer centers include Integrative Oncology trained physicians and other healthcare professionals in their team to discuss and recommend evidence-based integrative oncology therapies alongside conventional cancer treatments to their patients.",10.3390/curroncol28010084,University of Calgary,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

Guideline development involved a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2013-2023.RESULTSThe evidence base consisted of 113 RCTs. Exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and mindfulness-based programs led to improvements in CRF both during and after the completion of cancer treatment. Tai chi, qigong, and American ginseng showed benefits during treatment, whereas yoga, acupressure, and moxibustion helped to manage CRF after completion of treatment. Use of other dietary supplements did not improve CRF during or after cancer treatment. In patients at the end of life, CBT and corticosteroids showed benefits. Certainty and quality of evidence were low to moderate for CRF management interventions.RECOMMENDATIONSClinicians should recommend exercise, CBT, mindfulness-based programs, and tai chi or qigong to reduce the severity of fatigue during cancer treatment. Psychoeducation and American ginseng may be recommended in adults undergoing cancer treatment. For survivors after completion of treatment, clinicians should recommend exercise, CBT, and mindfulness-based programs; in particular, CBT and mindfulness-based programs have shown efficacy for managing moderate to severe fatigue after treatment. Yoga, acupressure, and moxibustion may also be recommended. Patients at the end of life may be offered CBT and corticosteroids. Clinicians should not recommend L-carnitine, antidepressants, wakefulness agents, or routinely recommend psychostimulants to manage symptoms of CRF. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against other psychosocial, integrative, or pharmacological interventions for the management of fatigue.Additional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.",10.1200/JCO.24.00541,"University of California, Los Angeles",0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

Physical activity (PA) can support interoceptive processes, but limited research has examined the association in children. This study explored the relations among parent-reported PA and several interoceptive domains in children aged 3 – 10 years old. Methods: Baseline data were analyzed from a cluster-randomized controlled study examining a yoga intervention (N = 122). Parents completed a questionnaire that included the Caregiver Questionnaire for Interoceptive Awareness, Second Edition (CQIA-2) and two measures of PA, the PROMIS Parent-Proxy Short Form (PROMIS-PA) and the adapted Burdette Proxy Report (aBPR-PA). Psychometrics of the CQIA-2 subscales were assessed and then used in subsequent analyses to examine the association between PA and interoceptive sensibility. Results: Seventy percent of the surveys were completed by mothers (30% by fathers), and their children (56% female, Mage = 5.81 ± 1.7 years) were predominately white. Across all children, PA had a significant positive relationship with interoceptive domains related to emotion and physical energy (p < 0.01). Children who met the PROMIS-PA “good” cutoff had a clearer sense of emotion and physical energy (F(2,115) = 4.30, p = 0.016, R2 = 0.070), compared to children who did not. Children's age predicted interoceptive sensibility of illness and toileting needs (F(1,116) = 14.16, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.109). Conclusion: Children with higher PA levels were perceived to have better interoceptive sensibility of emotion and physical energy. Children's age was predictive of interoceptive domains representing the awareness of illness and toileting needs. Future work should consider incorporating direct measures of PA and child-reported interoceptive sensibility.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Aromatase inhibitors (AI) reduce hormone receptor-positive breast cancer recurrence risk by about 50%. However, half of AI-treated postmenopausal women report new or worsened musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS), and 20% discontinue therapy prematurely. Acupuncture is effective for reducing symptoms, but many women are not able to access acupuncture therapy. We hypothesize that self-administered acupressure will reduce AIMSS. Materials and methods Postmenopausal women who have been receiving treatment with an AI for more than 3 weeks but less than 2 years, and who report new or worsened joint pain or myalgias since starting AI therapy with worst pain of at least 4 out of 10 on a numerical rating scale, are eligible. Fifty participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to treatment with true or sham acupressure for 12 weeks. Participants will self-apply pressure for 3 minutes to each of the 9 acupoints daily. All participants will complete a pain assessment weekly, and a battery of symptom questionnaires every 6 weeks. Optional stool samples will be collected after 0 and 12 weeks of acupressure to examine changes in the gut microbiome. The primary endpoint is change in worst pain on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form with 12 weeks of the acupressure intervention, evaluated with generalized estimating equations. Conclusion Determination that self-administered acupressure reduces AIMSS in this randomized phase 2 pilot trial will lead to a larger randomized phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the efficacy of self-acupressure. Reduction of AI-related arthralgias may improve persistence with breast cancer therapy, breast cancer outcomes, and quality of life for AI-treated patients.",10.1371/journal.pone.0311044,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

Clinical practice guidelines emphasize multimodal pain management including evidence-based complementary and integrative health treatments such as acupressure as a first line of care. Unfortunately, the ability to replicate interventions, cost, resources, and limited access are implementation barriers. Self-administered acupressure has shown positive effects on pain and can be practiced anywhere with little to no side effects. Methods/design: The aims of this Type 1 hybrid effectiveness implementation randomized controlled trial are 1) to determine effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure protocol at improving pain interference and secondary outcomes of fatigue, sleep quality, and disability in 300 Veterans with chronic low back pain, and 2) evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators to scale-up acupressure utilization within Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Participants randomized to the intervention will receive instruction on acupressure application using an app that facilitates daily practice for 6 weeks. During weeks 6 through 10, participants will discontinue acupressure to determine sustainability of effects. Participants randomized to waitlist control will continue their usual care for pain management and receive study materials at the end of the study period. Outcomes will be collected at baseline and at 6- and 10-weeks post baseline. The primary outcome is pain interference, measured by the PROMIS pain interference scale. Using established frameworks and a mixed methods approach, we will evaluate intervention implementation. Discussion: If acupressure is effective, we will tailor strategies to support implementation in the VHA based on study findings.

Precision nutrition, particularly adjusting fatty acid intake, offers a cost-effective strategy for enhancing SLE management. Prior research, including our own, indicates that increased consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with improved outcomes in SLE patients. Here we build upon these findings by investigating associations between serum fatty acids—grouped as PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)—and lupus activity, pain, and sleep disturbance. Methods: Using data from 418 participants with SLE in the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort, we examined associations between serum levels of 25 fatty acids determined by GC-MS and patient-reported outcomes. Disease activity, pain, and sleep quality were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Generalized additive models and partial residual plots were utilized to examine the linearity of fatty acid effects. Variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), followed by multiple linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results: Findings indicated favorable associations between ω-3 PUFAs—and, to a lesser extent, ω-6 PUFAs—and patient-reported outcomes, while MUFAs and SFAs showed unfavorable associations. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 PUFA, exhibited the most robust favorable associations across all outcomes. Additionally, the omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) was linked to reduced pain, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), another omega-3, was associated with worsened disease activity and pain.

Precision nutrition, particularly adjusting fatty acid intake, offers a cost-effective strategy for enhancing SLE management. Prior research, including our own, indicates that increased consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) correlates with improved outcomes in SLE patients. Here we build upon these findings by investigating associations between serum fatty acids—grouped as PUFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)—and lupus activity, pain, and sleep disturbance. Methods: Using data from 418 participants with SLE in the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort, we examined associations between serum levels of 25 fatty acids determined by GC-MS and patient-reported outcomes. Disease activity, pain, and sleep quality were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Generalized additive models and partial residual plots were utilized to examine the linearity of fatty acid effects. Variable selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), followed by multiple linear regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results: Findings indicated favorable associations between ω-3 PUFAs—and, to a lesser extent, ω-6 PUFAs—and patient-reported outcomes, while MUFAs and SFAs showed unfavorable associations. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 PUFA, exhibited the most robust favorable associations across all outcomes. Additionally, the omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) was linked to reduced pain, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), another omega-3, was associated with worsened disease activity and pain. Among omega-6 PUFAs, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA) was favorably associated with disease activity, while the omega-9 PUFA Mead acid was linked to increased pain. Discussion: These findings underscore the prospect that increased tissue levels of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA, are favorably associated with SLE outcomes. Although further research is needed to establish causal relationships, existing evidence supports the role of omega-3 PUFAs in managing cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, common SLE comorbidities.

Suzanna Zick,Associations between CD70 methylation of T cell DNA and age in adults with systemic lupus erythematosus and population controls: The Michigan Lupus Epidemiology &amp; Surveillance (MILES) Program,2024.0,Journal of Autoimmunity,Article,Aging; Autoimmunity; CD4+; CD8+; Epidemiology; Epigenetics; Immunoepidemiology; TNFSF7,"2023Background: Environmental factors can influence epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, potentially contributing to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) development and progression. We compared methylation of the B cell costimulatory CD70 gene, in persons with lupus and controls, and characterized associations with age. Results: In 297 adults with SLE and 92 controls from the Michigan Lupus Epidemiology and Surveillance (MILES) Cohort, average CD70 methylation of CD4+ T cell DNA across 10 CpG sites based on pyrosequencing of the promoter region was higher for persons with SLE compared to controls, accounting for covariates [β = 2.3, p = 0.011]. Using Infinium MethylationEPIC array data at 18 CD70-annoted loci (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell DNA), sites within the promoter region tended to be hypomethylated in SLE, while those within the gene region were hypermethylated. In SLE but not controls, age was significantly associated with pyrosequencing-based CD70 methylation: for every year increase in age, methylation increased by 0.14 percentage points in SLE, accounting for covariates. Also within SLE, CD70 methylation approached a significantly higher level in Black persons compared to White persons (β = 1.8, p = 0.051). Conclusions: We describe altered CD70 methylation patterns in T lymphocyte subsets in adults with SLE relative to controls, and report associations particular to SLE between methylation of this immune-relevant gene and both age and race, possibly a consequence of “weathering” or accelerated aging which may have implications for SLE pathogenesis and potential intervention strategies.",10.1016/j.jaut.2023.103137,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

Oncology providers rarely receive training about dietary supplements. We evaluated whether e-learning modules could improve oncology providers’ dietary supplement knowledge. Oncology providers participated in the National Cancer Institute funded Integrative Oncology Scholars (IOS) program. We used posttest readiness assurance tests (RAT) to measure knowledge acquisition from modules. One cohort completed a pre and posttest RAT to assess change in knowledge. Multivariate linear regression models adjusted for gender, race, profession, and years in practice were used to determine if these characteristics were associated with posttest RAT performance and change in pre to posttest RAT scores. Scholars (N = 101) included 86% (N = 87) females; age 44 ± 10 years; 72% (N = 73) Non-Hispanic White; years in practice mean range 11–15 ± 10. There were 37 physicians, 11 physician assistants, 23 nurses, 21 social workers, 2 psychologists, 4 pharmacists, and 2 physical therapists. The posttest dietary supplement and antioxidant RAT scores for all Scholars were 67 ± 18% and 71 ± 14%. In adjusted models there were no significant associations between dietary supplement and antioxidant posttest RAT scores with Scholar characteristics. Change in RAT scores for dietary supplement and antioxidants were 25% ± 23 and 26% ± 27 (P < 0.0001). In adjusted models, there were no significant predictors of change in dietary supplement RATs. For antioxidant RATs, profession was associated with change in scores (P = 0.021). Improvement in Scholar’s test scores demonstrate the IOS program can significantly increase oncology providers’ knowledge of dietary supplements and antioxidants.",10.1007/s13187-023-02348-y,Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center,0000-0003-0914-4927,56521833600.0,

We investigated whether cost-related non-adherence (CRNA) to prescription medications was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes in a population-based systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort. Methods: Sociodemographic and prescription data were collected by structured interviews in 2014–2015 from patients meeting SLE criteria in the established Michigan Lupus Epidemiology & Surveillance (MILES) Cohort. We examined the associations between CRNA and potential confounders such as sociodemographics and health insurance coverage, and outcome measures of SLE activity and damage using multivariable linear regression. Results: 462 SLE participants completed the study visit: 430 (93.1%) female, 208 (45%) Black, and mean age 53.3 years. 100 (21.6%) participants with SLE reported CRNA in the preceding 12 months. After adjusting for covariates, CRNA was associated with both higher levels of current SLE disease activity [SLAQ: β coeff 2.7 (95% CI 1.3, 4.1), p < 0.001] and damage [LDIQ β coeff 1.4 (95% CI 0.5, 2.4), p = 0.003]. Race, health insurance status, and fulfilling Fibromyalgia (FM) Survey Criteria were independently associated with both higher (worse) SLAQ and LDIQ scores; female sex was further associated with higher SLAQ scores. Conclusion: Patients with SLE who reported CRNA in the previous 12 months had significantly worse self-reported current disease activity and damage scores compared to those not reporting CRNA.

Identifying and addressing barriers to eyeglasses in this population are critical to maximize youth academic performance, workplace productivity, and quality of life. PURPOSE We aimed to understand youth experiences with eye health, assess the value that youth place on vision, and identify barriers to refractive correction directly from a nationwide sample of youth to inform interventions to address uncorrected refractive error in this population. METHODS An open-ended poll was distributed to the MyVoice Text Message Cohort of U.S. youth eliciting youth experiences with eye health and barriers to wearing eyeglasses. Text message responses were coded using grounded theory. RESULTS Of 1204 recipients, 88.3% (n = 1063) responded. The mean age ± standard deviation was 20.3 ± 2.4 years, 58.8% (n = 625) were male, 74.0% (n = 787) were White, and 41.4% (n = 440) reported low socioeconomic status. Four major themes emerged from the open-ended responses: (1) many youth have experienced problems with their eyes or eyesight (n = 699 [65.8%]); (2) many youth value their eyesight highly (n = 905 [85.1%]; e.g., ""Eyesight is one of the most important aspects of my health, particularly in our digital world.""); (3) common reasons youth might not wear glasses even if they need them include concerns over appearance (n = 553 [52.0%]; e.g., ""I thought every pair made me look ugly.""), cost (n = 171 [16.1%]), inconvenience (n = 166 [15.6%]), and discomfort (n = 104 [9.8%]); and (4) youth are open to purchasing eyeglasses online (n = 539 [50.7%]). CONCLUSIONS Appearance, cost, inconvenience, and discomfort are critical barriers to wearing eyeglasses among U.S. youth. A multisectoral response is necessary to address these barriers.",10.1097/OPX.0000000000002003,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

Previous research has explored barriers to treatment among individuals diagnosed with eating disorders, but little is known about general adolescent and emerging adult perceptions of eating disorders, as compared to other mental health illnesses, a population at greatest risk for developing an eating disorder, and a population that may be important sources of information or support for peers. Method: A sample of adolescents and emerging adults aged 14–24 years (mean age 19 years) from MyVoice, a national text-message-based cohort (53% female, 38% male, 9% other, race/ethnicity 63% White, 10% Black or African American, 13% Asian, 9% Mixed Race, and 5% Other) provided open-ended responses to questions on the severity of eating disorders as compared to other mental health diagnoses, others' perceptions of eating disorders and potential treatment barriers. Responses were collected using a secure online platform and analyzed using content analysis. Results: Among respondents (n = 792/1283), 91% felt that eating disorders were a mental health condition and 65% felt that eating disorders were as serious as other mental health conditions, while 21% said they were more serious than other mental health conditions. Responses to questions related to perception and barriers illustrated that beliefs of eating disorders involve blame, stigma, and overall lack of understanding. Discussion: Findings from this study illustrate that there is a lack of understanding around eating disorders that could be addressed in youth-focused initiatives. Public Significance: Adolescents and emerging adults understand that eating disorders are severe mental illnesses that are not taken seriously by others, especially in comparison with other mental health diagnoses. Adolescents and emerging adults report that individuals with eating disorders are blamed for their condition and face shame and stigma. The lack of understanding around eating disorders should be addressed in youth-focused prevention initiatives.",10.1002/eat.23772,Michigan Medicine,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

Obesity published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Obesity Society.Objective: This study aimed to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a 2-year motivational interviewing (MI) intervention versus usual primary care. Methods: A national trial was implemented in the Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) network of the American Academy of Pediatrics to evaluate MI versus usual care for children (2-8 years old; baseline BMI 85th-97th percentiles). Health care use, food costs, provider fees, and training costs were assessed, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Primary outcome was the ICER, calculated as cost per unit change in BMI percentile for intervention versus usual care. Results: At 2 years, 72% of enrolled parent/child dyads were retained; 312 children were included in the analysis. Mean BMI percentile point change was −4.9 and −1.8 for the intervention and control, respectively, yielding an incremental reduction of 3.1 BMI percentile points (95% CI: 1.2-5.0). The intervention cost $1051 per dyad ($658 for training DVD development). Incorporating health care and non-health care costs, the intervention ICER was $363 (range from sensitivity analyses: cost saving, $3159) per BMI percentile point decrease per participant over 2 years. Conclusions: Training pediatricians, nurse practitioners, and registered dietitians to deliver MI-based interventions for childhood obesity in primary care is clinically effective and acceptably cost-effective. Future work should explore this approach in broader dissemination.",10.1002/oby.23560,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

Objective: The objective was to measure the frequency of dietary counseling documentation for patients recently hospitalized with CVD. Design: This was an observational study. Participants and setting: Patients were included from the Michigan Value Collaborative Multipayer Claims Registry from October 2015 to February 2020. Main outcome measure: The study measured the frequency of medical claims that document dietary counseling ≤90 days after hospitalization (ie, an episode of care) for CVD events (coronary artery bypass grafting, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and percutaneous coronary intervention). Dietary counseling documentation was defined as having an encounter-level International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision code for dietary counseling or current procedural terminology code for medical nutrition therapy or cardiac rehabilitation. Statistical analyses performed: Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure variation in documentation across gender, age, comorbidities, hospital geography, CVD event, and insurer. Results: There were 175,631 episodes of care (congesitve heart failure 47.1%, acute myocardial infarction 28.7%, percutaneous coronary intervention 17.0%, and coronary artery bypass grafting 7.3%) among 146,185 individuals. Most episodes occurred among men (55.8%) and those older than age 65 years (71.9%). Dietary counseling was documented for 22.8% of episodes and was more common as cardiac rehabilitation (18.6%) than other encounter types (5.1%). In multivariable analysis, there was lower odds for dietary counseling documentation among those older than age 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.77; P < .001), women (OR 0.83; P < .001), with chronic kidney disease (OR 0.74; P < .001), or diabetes (OR 0.95; P < .001), but greater odds for those with obesity (OR 1.28; P < .001) and nonmetropolitan hospitals (OR 1.31; P < .001). Compared with coronary artery bypass grafting, acute myocardial infarction (OR 0.29; P < .001), confestive heart failure (OR 0.12; P < .001), and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 0.36; P < .001) episodes had lower odds to have dietary counseling coded. Compared with Traditional Medicare, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization plans had lower odds, whereas Commercial or Medicare Advantage preferred provider organization and Commercial health maintenance organization plans had higher odds to have dietary counseling documented. Results were mostly similar when evaluated by race. Conclusions: Dietary counseling was infrequently documented after hospitalization for CVD episodes in medical claims in a Michigan-based multipayer claims database with large variation by reason for hospitalization and patient factors.",10.1016/j.jand.2024.03.003,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support the provision of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the contraceptive implant to women immediately after childbirth. We aimed to assess perceived training needs and barriers to immediate postpartum contraceptive service delivery among US family physicians. METHODS: We contributed items regarding postpartum contraception to the 2015 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) omnibus survey of a national cohort of family medicine educators. We assessed self-estimated adequacy of training to insert IUDs and implants immediately postpartum, how often these services are provided, and barriers to service provision RESULTS: Our sample of 409 respondents who provide labor and delivery maternity care was primarily Caucasian (79.9%) and female (56.0%). Significantly fewer respondents felt comfortable counseling about long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), inserting an IUD, and inserting an implant immediately postpartum compared to at 6+ weeks postpartum (all comparisons P<0.001). Fewer respondents felt adequately trained to insert an immediate postpartum IUD (36.4%) than an implant (58.7%; P<0.001). Most respondents had never placed an immediate postpartum IUD (81.17%) or implant (80.1%). Device unavailability was the most commonly cited reason for never having placed an immediate postpartum IUD (67.8%) or implant (71.2%) at one’s institution. CONCLUSIONS: As reimbursement for immediate postpartum contraception becomes more common, family physicians are on the front lines to make these services available to patients who desire them.

All rights reserved.Importance: Food insecurity is a risk factor for poor cardiovascular outcomes that occur disproportionately among individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds who have cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiometabolic risk factors. Objective: To assess long-term prevalence of food insecurity among those with CVD or cardiometabolic risk factors in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This serial cross-sectional study includes data for noninstitutionalized US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018). Main Outcomes and Measures: Food insecurity was assessed using the US Department of Agriculture Adult Food Security Survey Module. We estimated prevalence of food insecurity among adults with prior CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and cardiometabolic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia) across racial and ethnic groups and prevalence of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation among those reporting food insecurity. Results: In the analytic sample of 57517 adults, 6770 individuals (11.8%) reported food insecurity, which was more prevalent among Hispanic (1938 [24.0%]) and non-Hispanic Black (1202 [18.2%]) than non-Hispanic Asian (100 [8.0%]) and non-Hispanic White adults (3221 [8.5%]). Among 57517 adults, 4527 (7.9%) had any CVD, 2933 (5.1%) coronary artery disease, 1536 (2.7%) stroke, 1363 (2.4%) heart failure, 28528 (49.6%) hypertension, 17979 (33.2%) obesity, 6418 (11.2%) diabetes, and 19178 (30.8%) dyslipidemia. All CVD and cardiometabolic diseases except coronary artery disease were more prevalent among those with food insecurity. Food insecurity increased over time and was more frequent for patients with CVD but not for cardiometabolic risk factors. From 2011 to 2018, non-Hispanic Black adults with CVD had a decrease in food insecurity prevalence (36.6%; 95% CI, 23.9%-49.4%, to 25.4%; 95% CI, 21.4%-29.3%; P =.04 for trend), whereas adults of other races and ethnicities or data based on cardiometabolic risk factors had no significant change. For individuals who had food insecurity, SNAP participation was higher among those with CVD vs without CVD (54.2%; 95% CI, 46.6%-61.8%, vs 44.3%; 95% CI, 40.5%-48.1%; P =.01). Conclusions and Relevance: The prevalence of food insecurity among patients with CVD increased over time. Although members of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic groups had the highest food insecurity, non-Hispanic Black individuals with CVD were the only group to have a significant decrease in food insecurity since 2011. Increased recognition of food insecurity and resources for treating it are needed to address the negative consequences of food insecurity on CVD outcomes..",10.1001/jamacardio.2022.3729,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Despite decades of calls for increased diversity in the health research workforce, disparities exist for many populations, including Black, Indigenous, and People of Color individuals, those from low-income families, and first-generation college students. To increase representation of historically marginalized populations, there is a critical need to develop programs that strengthen their path toward health research careers. High school is a critically important time to catalyze interest and rebuild engagement among youth who may have previously felt excluded from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and health research careers. Methods The overall objective of the MYHealth program is to engage high school students in a community-based participatory research program focused on adolescent health. Investigators will work alongside community partners to recruit 9th through 12th graders who self-identify as a member of a group underrepresented in STEM or health research careers (e.g., based on race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, first generation college student, disability, etc.). MYHealth students are trained to be co-researchers who work alongside academic researchers, which will help them to envision themselves as scientists capable of positively impacting their communities through research. Implemented in three phases, the MYHealth program aims to foster a continuing interest in health research careers by developing: 1) researcher identities, 2) scientific literacy, 3) scientific self-efficacy, and 4) teamwork and leadership self-efficacy. In each phase, students will build knowledge and skills in research, ethics, data collection, data analysis, and dissemination. Students will directly collaborate with and be mentored by a team that includes investigators, community advisors, scientific advisors, and youth peers. Discussion Each year, a new cohort of up to 70 high school students will be enrolled in MYHealth. We anticipate the MYHealth program will increase interest and persistence in STEM and health research among groups that have been historically excluded in health research careers.",10.1371/journal.pone.0281790,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,46623893.0

Excess weight gain during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for long-term obesity among mothers and their infants. There is a significant gap in our understanding of youth's knowledge and behavior related to weight gain during pregnancy. To develop effective interventions for pregnant youth, it is necessary to understand their distinct needs and preferences. Using a youth-centered qualitative approach, the purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge, behaviors, and social factors that influence weight gain during pregnancy for youth. Design: Participants completed weekly text message surveys and semistructured interviews to explore their perspectives of weight gain during pregnancy. Data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis on the basis of grounded theory. Setting and Participants: Pregnant youth ages 16-24 years old recruited from 2 urban, low-income, primary care clinics in Southeast Michigan. Interventions, Main Outcome Measures, and Results: Among our sample (N = 54) 4 themes emerged. First, many youths were knowledgeable about healthy behaviors in pregnancy. However, the second theme showed that many youths reported barriers to engaging in these healthy behaviors, including stress, poor motivation, and issues of convenience. Third, they showed inadequate knowledge about exercise in pregnancy, and fourth, many endorsed food cravings that significantly influenced diet choices. Conclusion: Many pregnant youths have appropriate knowledge about healthy behaviors during pregnancy, but face many youth-specific barriers to achieving these behaviors. Interventions should address logistical challenges (eg, food access, cost, transportation) to healthy behaviors in pregnancy to make healthy diet and exercise more convenient for pregnant youth.",10.1016/j.jpag.2019.10.001,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-2905-5000,54383802700.0,

Methods: Participants (adolescents and young adults in the United States, 14-24 years of age) were texted five open-ended questions about their perceptions of various aspects of breastfeeding including their initial reaction to breastfeeding, the impact on the infant and parent, how it compares with formula, and whether they were breastfed. The responses were analyzed for themes using an inductive content analysis approach. Responses were compared using χ2 tests to assess if knowledge and education about breastfeeding differed according to gender identity and age. Results: Among 1,283 participants, 829 responded (response rate = 64.4%). The average age was 18.8 (standard deviation [SD] = 2.9), with 53% female and 10% Black. Most adolescents and young adults understand there are health benefits of breastfeeding for the breastfeeding dyad (n = 589; 78.8%), yet also indicate an awareness of negative aspects (n = 256; 36.1%). Participants who identified as female or gender-variant and those who were older were more likely to refer to the emotional and bonding connections breastfeeding creates (p = 0.0011 and p = 0.0002). Males were more likely to have less knowledge about breastfeeding effects on the breastfeeding person but have more negative attitudes toward formula (p = 0.0298 and p = 0.0543). Younger respondents tended to indicate that formula was better than breast milk (p = 0.0534). Conclusion: We found a mix of positive and negative perceptions of breastfeeding among adolescents and young adults. Understanding how youth view breastfeeding can inform targeted education for this population that includes all genders and can begin before pregnancy.",10.1089/bfm.2023.0267,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: Vaccine incentives have been used across the US to encourage COVID-19 vaccine uptake and include programs targeted to adolescents and young adults. However, little is known about youths' views regarding these initiatives. Objective: To assess experiences and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine incentives in a nationwide sample of US youth. Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative survey study was conducted using the MyVoice text message-based polling platform from October 22 to October 29, 2021. Participants were US adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 24 years, who were sent 5 open-ended questions to assess their experiences and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine incentives. Qualitative responses were analyzed thematically. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed in January 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Experiences, perceptions, and opinions related to COVID-19 vaccine incentives as measured by survey response. Results: A total of 1125 of 1206 youth (93%) responded to the survey and had a mean (SD) age of 20 (2) years, 664 (59%) identified as male, and 769 (68%) identified as non-Hispanic White. Of respondents, 871 (79%) reported having heard of vaccine incentives, and 892 (82%) believed they were a good idea or had positive attributes. Notably, 305 youth (28%) expressed concerns about vaccine incentives, citing uncertainty about their effectiveness (86 [28%]), their ethical use (63 [21%]), the impact on vaccine motivations (51 [17%]), and confidence (39 [13%]), and lack of fairness (35 [11%]). Only 73 youth (7%) reported that an incentive influenced their decision to get a COVID-19 vaccine. When asked what they thought would motivate others to get a COVID-19 vaccine, youth with an opinion (536 of 1032 [52%]) most commonly reported incentives (112 [21%]) and additional COVID-19 vaccine testing, safety, or regulation (115 [21%]). Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 vaccine incentives are well known to youth but not a significant self-reported motivator for vaccination. Although generally viewed favorably, more than a quarter of youth expressed concerns regarding vaccine incentives, including but not limited to their ethics, effectiveness, fairness, and impacts on vaccine motivation and confidence. Policymakers considering targeted use of COVID-19 vaccine incentives should weigh youths' perspectives on these initiatives alongside objective effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data.",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.16628,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,
Tammy Chang,Perspectives about and approaches to weight gain in pregnancy: A qualitative study of physicians and nurse midwives,2013.0,BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,Article,Weight Gain; Pregnancy; Nurse Midwives; Certified nurse midwives; Family physician; Gestational weight gain; Obesity; Obstetrics; Prenatal care; Qualitative study,"Background: Over one third of reproductive age women in the US are obese. Pregnancy is a strong risk factor for obesity, with excess weight gain as the greatest predictor of long term obesity. The majority of pregnant women gain more weight than recommended by the Institute of Medicine guidelines. The objective of this study was to understand prenatal care providers' perspectives on weight gain during pregnancy.Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews of 10 prenatal care providers (three family physicians, three obstetricians, and four nurse midwives) at a University Hospital in the Midwest, that included the ranking of important prenatal issues, and open-ended questions addressing: 1) general perceptions; 2) approach with patients; and 3) clinical care challenges.Results: Providers felt that appropriate weight gain during pregnancy was not a high priority. Many providers waited until patients had gained excess weight before addressing the issue, were not familiar with established guidelines, and lacked resources for patients. Providers also believed that their counseling had low impact on patients, avoided counseling due to sensitivity of the topic, and believed that patients were more influenced by other factors, such as their family, habits, and culture.Conclusions: Both providers and patients may benefit from increased awareness of the morbidity of excess weight gain during pregnancy. Practice-level policies that support the monitoring and management of weight gain during pregnancy could also improve care. Research that further investigates the barriers to appropriate weight gain is warranted. © 2013 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",10.1186/1471-2393-13-47,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-1699-5079,8077184300.0,

All rights reserved.Importance: Rights and access for transgender individuals, including the participation of transgender athletes in sports, have long been debated. These discussions often center around fairness and mental health impacts on youths associated with identity-based inclusion in sports. Objective: To assess the experiences and perspectives of adolescents and young adults on the inclusion of transgender individuals in competitive sports. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, 5 open-ended survey questions were sent to the MyVoice cohort from December 10 to 17, 2021. MyVoice is a nationwide text-message polling platform of US youths aged 14 to 24 years. All coding and subsequent analysis was completed between January 10 and December 11, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Qualitative perspectives of youths regarding transgender athlete participation in sports as measured by survey responses. Responses were reviewed using an inductive approach to qualitative thematic analysis to develop a codebook. The codes were independently applied to all responses by 2 investigators; discrepancies were resolved with discussion. Summary statistics were calculated for demographic characteristics and code frequencies, and χ2 tests (α =.05, 2-tailed) were used to evaluate differences in opinion based on gender identity and participation in competitive sports. Results: A total of 905 of 1199 youths (75%) responded to the survey. Respondents had a mean (SD) age of 20 (2) years; 482 (53%) identified as male, 29 (3%) identified as transgender, and 306 (34%) reported having participated in high school and/or collegiate athletics. Three themes emerged: (1) youths differed regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes based on gender identity vs sex assigned at birth, (2) many youths did not have personal experience related to the inclusion of transgender athletes, and (3) youths were uncertain about the impacts of gender identity-based participation on cisgender individuals but perceived positive impacts for transgender individuals. Nearly half of respondents (327 of 691 [47%]) thought that transgender athletes should participate based on their gender identity or personal preference, whereas 240 (35%) favored participation based on sex assigned at birth or in a transgender-only category. Respondents mentioned concern about the fairness of identity-based participation, specifically for cisgender women, but many (410 of 697 [59%]) also reported that it would be affirming for transgender athletes to participate based on gender identity. Conclusions and Relevance: The youths in our study differed in their opinions regarding sports participation of transgender youths, but many felt that inclusive policies would affirm and support the mental health of transgender individuals. Negative impacts on fairness were noted by some respondents. These findings suggest that nuanced policies are needed to address the participation of transgender athletes in competitive sports and should consider the impacts on and perspectives of youths most affected..",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.55107,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

Despite youth status as ""tech natives,""limited data are available on their perspectives on telemedicine. Our study seeks to understand youth telemedicine knowledge, prior experiences, preferences for use, and the impact of COVID-19 on these perspectives. Methods: Participants in MyVoice, a national text message cohort of U.S. youth age 14-24, were sent five open-ended questions in October 2019 and October 2020. A codebook was iteratively developed by using inductive analysis. Responses were independently coded by two investigators, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or a third investigator. Results: Sixty-five percent (836/1,283) and 77% (887/1,129) of participants responded to at least 1 question in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Most youth reported awareness of telemedicine and although many have not used it, COVID-19 has increased use. Further, many are willing to try telemedicine services. Most youth noted a preference for video rather than phone visits, but they believe both to be less effective than in person. Youth also reported varied preferences on services best suited for telemedicine, with COVID-19 positively impacting their views. Discussion: Youth are aware of and willing to use telemedicine services, with many reporting use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth are willing to accept a wide variety of telemedicine services, though they still desire in-person options. Health systems and clinics should offer a wide range of services via telemedicine to fit the varying needs of youth both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",10.1089/tmj.2021.0153,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

There is a lack of data regarding perspectives of US adolescents and young adults on their dental health and oral hygiene practice. Methods Adolescents and young adults, age 14-24, from MyVoice, a nationwide text message poll of youth. were asked five open-ended questions on the importance of dental health and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. Chi-square test was used to examine differences in experiences by demographics. Results Of 1,148 participants, 932 responded to at least one question. The mean age was 19 years. Respondents were largely male (49.5%) and non-Hispanic white (62.4%). Most (92%) respondents perceived dental health as important or somewhat important and emphasized overall dental health and hygiene (38.6%) and aesthetics (18.3%). About half (49.2%) of respondents stated they have had at least one cavity since middle school. Just over half (54.8%) reported brushing and flossing to care for their dentition. 58% visited a dentist at least every 6 months, while 38% visited a dentist less frequently or not at all. Being non-cisgender, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and receipt of free or reduced lunch was associated with less frequent dental visits. 44% stated COVID-19 impacted their dental health, with many mentioning scheduling difficulties or worsened dental hygiene.",10.1371/journal.pone.0280533,University of Michigan School of Dentistry,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

All rights reserved.Background: Youth are increasingly upholding significant caregiving responsibilities. These caregiving responsibilities can have emotional, educational, and professional impacts on youth and young adults. And yet, policies and resources focus on adult caregivers and are limited in supporting young caregivers. The purpose of this study was to describe the different types of support that youth identify as being important to prepare to take care of an adult relative. Methods: We conducted an open-ended, text-message based poll of youth ages 14 to 24 in August 2020. We conducted a content analysis to categorize and describe the different types of support respondents identified in their responses. We compared types of support identified by age-group, gender identity, and prior caregiving experience. Results: Most respondents (42.2%) identified education (eg, skills training) as being an important resource. Other types of support reported included financial support (eg, assistive programs), workplace policies (eg, paid leave), mental health support, and professional support. Discussion: Policy makers should extend existing policies (eg, Family and Medical Leave Act) to include and consider the circumstances of youth and young adults. Policies enabling young caregivers to actively participate in their adult relative’s health care visits could be critical to preparing youth for the skills required and the physical and emotional demands associated with caregiving. Coordinated efforts between health and education systems could support youth in learning information about caregiving, medical decision making, and medical tasks.",10.3122/jabfm.2022.04.210540,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of text message surveys in a clinical setting and to describe key lessons to minimize attrition. Methods: We obtained a convenience sample of individuals who entered the waiting room of a low-income, primary care clinic. Participants were asked to answer between 17 and 30 survey questions on a variety of health-related topics, including both open- and closed-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the participants and determine the response rates. Bivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of incomplete surveys. Results: Our convenience sample consisted of 461 individuals. Of those who attempted the survey, 80% (370/461) completed it in full. The mean age of respondents was 35.4 years (standard deviation = 12.4). Respondents were predominantly non-Hispanic black (42%) or non-Hispanic white (41%), female (75%), and with at least some college education (70%). Of those who completed the survey, 84% (312/370) reported willingness to do another text message survey. Those with incomplete surveys answered a median of nine questions before stopping. Smartphone users were less likely to leave the survey incomplete compared with non-smartphone users (p = 0.004). Discussion: Text-message surveys are a feasible and acceptable method to collect real-time data among low-income, clinic-based populations. Offering participants a setting for immediate survey completion, minimizing survey length, simplifying questions, and allowing ""free text"" responses for all questions may optimize response rates.",10.1089/tmj.2017.0022,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-6646-9918,57199720858.0,

Methods: We utilized MyVoice, a nationwide text message survey of AYAs, to pose 6 open-ended questions on their perceptions and use of STI self-collection kits. Two independent reviewers used inductive content analysis to develop a codebook and analyze responses, and a third settled any coding discrepancies through discussion to reach consensus. Code frequencies and demographic data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: We collected responses from 763 participants. Individuals who answered at least one question were included in the sample. Responses indicated that most (n = 695, 91.1%) participants would use free STI self-collection kits. Participants who would not use an STI self-collection kit (n = 45, 5.9%) cited concerns about test result accuracy and discomfort with specimen collection. Discussion: Survey respondents were amenable to using free, STI self-collection kits; however, some were concerned about accuracy. There is an urgent need to prioritize and increase the accessibility of STI testing among youth. STI self-collection kits are an effective and accessible option that addresses barriers to reproductive health-care services—stigma, inconvenience, and lack of privacy. A social media campaign focusing on AYAs may increase knowledge and use of STI self-collection kits through dissemination of accurate information, stigma reduction, and provision of accessible resources that empower AYAs to prioritize their sexual health.",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2024.10.028,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

The leading risk factor for skin cancer is sun exposure in adolescence. Given this, sun protection in young adults is an effective way to reduce the occurrence of skin cancer. The goal of this study is to identify knowledge, behaviors, and barriers among young adults toward the use of sunscreen. Primary care physicians interact with a large number of young adults and have the ideal opportunity to counsel this population. Objective: To identify youths' knowledge and experiences with sun protection and elicit recommendations to increase protection usage. Study Design: Data was obtained using MyVoice, a national poll of youth (www.hearmyvoicenow.org). Five open-ended questions were sent via text message to 1,151 youth on April 9, 2021. Responses were analyzed by two independent investigators after using a modified grounded theory approach to iteratively develop codes based on salient themes. Setting: Participants are youth from the United States aged 14-24 years old who were recruited from social media to meet national benchmarks based on weighted samples of the American Community Survey. Results: Of 1,151 youth, 977 responded to at least one question (response rate= 84.9%). Respondents' mean age was 19.3 years (SD=2.4), 48.1% identified as male, and 62.2% as non-Hispanic white. Nearly all respondents stated ""It is very important"" or ""It's important!"" (62.1%, 25.5% respectively) to protect your skin from the sun. The most frequently reported reason for using sun protection was to ""reduce the risk of getting skin cancer"" (51.7%). Nearly all (90.1%) youth reported use of sunscreen, but 81.1% of respondents have had at least one sunburn and 28.4% have had 5 or more ""Many [sunburns], and yes some have blistered"". Participants commonly recommended emphasizing the consequences of sun exposure to encourage sun protection use, ""Inform people about the dangers of not wearing sun protection"" (41.1%). Conclusions: Youth in our nationwide sample understand both the short and long term risks of sun exposure and believe that sun protection is important. Though nearly all reported sunscreen use, youth struggle with implementation of consistent sun protective behaviors with a large number reporting numerous sunburns. These youth reported insights can inform more effective strategies to improve the use of sun protection by youth.",10.1370/afm.20.s1.3115,,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

MyVoice, a national text message survey of youth aged 14–24 years, posed five open-ended questions on experiences and perceptions of disaster readiness in November 2021. Youth were asked about their experiences with disasters, whether they anticipate experiencing a disaster in the near future, perceived personal disaster readiness, how they would obtain information in the event of a disaster, and what they could do now to prepare for a disaster. Responses were reviewed to identify themes and iteratively develop a codebook. Two reviewers independently coded responses to each question and resolved discrepancies via discussion to reach a consensus. Summary statistics were calculated for demographic and thematic analysis. A total of 1,083 respondents answered at least one question (89.9% response rate). Two themes were identified: (a) youth or their loved ones have experienced severe disasters and expect these events to be more frequent in the future and (b) youth have important insights on knowledge and actions about readiness. Youth are significant stakeholders in developing strategies to be ready for disasters, and their insights can lead to policy development that allows youth to prioritize effective readiness strategies to mitigate the potentially traumatic impacts and promote individual and community resilience.",10.1037/trm0000515,University of Michigan School of Nursing,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

Millions of women and girls around the world experience period poverty, which can contribute to disparities in school and work performance, as well as overall quality of life. However, not much is known about youth experiences and perceptions of period poverty. This study aims to understand the personal experiences and opinions of American youth regarding knowledge about menstruation and period poverty, as well as to gauge youth attitudes of existing and future period poverty initiatives. Methods: The MyVoice nationwide text message poll was used to ask five open-ended questions to over 1,000 youth across the United States aged 14–24 years. Responses were analyzed using content analysis by two independent researchers, and differences in coding were reviewed and resolved by discussion. Results: Overall, 963 youth (80%) responded, and the sample was 54.7% self-reported male with an average age of 20.1 years (standard deviation = 2.3). Three main themes emerged: 1. Most youth, regardless of self-reported gender, have had conversations about periods but comfort discussing the topic varies, 2. Youths' knowledge of menstruation varies with personal experience, or lack thereof, and 3. Some youth have experience with period poverty, and most are overwhelmingly supportive of policies to improve access to period products. Discussion: These findings suggest that normalization of discussions of menstruation, increasing awareness of the prevalence and impacts of period poverty, and greater implementation of programs to mitigate period poverty are supported by youth, and may reduce period poverty in the United States.",10.1016/j.jadohealth.2024.02.018,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

To assess these preferences, we surveyed youth regarding their perspectives on their medical team's role in addressing SDOHs. Methods: We conducted a national text message survey of youth aged 14–24 years. The survey asked five open-ended questions about SDOHs and SDOH interventions. Qualitative data were analyzed independently by two investigators using thematic analysis. Prevalence of codes was summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: Among 1,156 participants, 1,038 responded to at least one survey question (response rate = 89.8%). Respondents were 19.2 (standard deviation: 2.4) years old on average, 48.9% male, 62.1% non-Hispanic white, and 38.9% qualified for free or reduced lunch. A large majority of our sample (81%) indicated that they think it is important for their doctor or medical team to ask about SDOHs. The most commonly reported barrier to seeking or receiving SDOH assistance was embarrassment (30%). Youth wanted their providers to help with SDOHs not only by providing information about resources (25%) and referrals (13%) but also by offering general advice (22%) and listening (11%). Approximately half (51%) of our sample preferred to receive information about SDOH assistance in person.

To assess these impacts, we surveyed youth regarding their experiences with, and perspectives on, the long-term effects of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a nationwide text message survey of youth ages 14–24 years in the United States. The survey asked four open ended questions regarding their experiences and perceptions regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19. Qualitative data was analyzed independently by three investigators using thematic analysis. Prevalence of codes were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: Among 1150 participants, 991 responded to at least one survey question (response rate 86.1%). The vast majority of our sample had COVID-19 or knew someone who did (75%), and approximately one third (32%) of youth indicated that they knew someone who had experienced symptoms consistent with Long Covid. Many youth (50%) reported worry and concern about Long Covid even if they, or someone they knew, did not have Long Covid. Among youth who were not concerned about Long Covid, the most commonly reported reasons were having received the vaccine (29%) and not having a prior COVID-19 infection (24%). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that among younger populations, there is significant concern regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19. Vaccination campaigns and youth-centered public health communication about Long Covid may not only reduce COVID-19 transmission, but also alleviate worries and concerns about Long Covid among youth.",10.1186/s12889-023-16899-8,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,
Tammy Chang,Youth preferences for healthcare providers and healthcare interactions: a qualitative study,2024.0,BMC Primary Care,Article,Adolescent healthcare; Concordance; Patient-physician relationships; Adolescent healthcare; Concordance; Patient-physician relationships,"The Author(s) 2024.Background: Patient-physician relationships in healthcare can influence healthcare provision, patient engagement, and health outcomes. Little is known about youth preferences on types and characteristics of their healthcare providers. The aim of this study was to assess youth perspectives on preferences for and interactions with their healthcare providers. Methods: We posed 5 open-ended questions to 1,163 MyVoice participants, a nationwide text message cohort of United States youth aged 14–24, on April 10, 2020 related to youth preferences for healthcare providers. Content analysis was used to develop a codebook. Responses were independently coded by two reviewers with discrepancies discussed to reach consensus. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics and frequency of codes. Results: 944 (81%) participants responded to at least one question. Respondents had a mean age of 18.9 years (SD: 2.8) and were a majority female (53.6%) and White (56.3%). Youth reported “kindness” or other personality traits (31%) and education (30%) as important in choosing their doctor. Patient-physician concordance was not important to many youths (44%) and among those who reported concordance as important (55%), having the same gender was the most noted (68%). Youth suggested respect, open conversation, and addressing issues directly to help alleviate uncomfortable situations, though some would simply switch providers. Conclusion: Personality and empathy are important provider characteristics valued by youth. Female respondents preferred gender concordant providers, particularly for sexual health-related issues, and non-white respondents were more likely to prefer racial concordance. Strengthening professional and interpersonal skills among youth-serving providers may improve healthcare engagement and satisfaction among youth.",10.1186/s12875-024-02300-z,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,provided the original author and source are credited.Background Social gatherings are frequent sources of COVID-19 infections, especially among youth. However, little is known about youth testing behaviors before and after gatherings. Our aim was to assess behaviors and perceptions of youth related to testing for COVID-19 before or after social gatherings in order to inform efforts to reduce disease spread. Methods Five open-ended questions were texted to participants aged 14–24 throughout the United States via MyVoice. Using a content analysis approach, two investigators reviewed responses by question, developed a codebook, and independently applied codes. Discrepancies were resolved via discussion. Code frequency and demographic data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results Of 1204 participants, 989 responded to at least one question (RR = 94.1%). The mean age was 20.2 years (SD: 2.4 years). Most participants (80.7%) reported testing for COVID-19 at least once. Most (70.6%) were likely to test following an event, especially “[i]f someone at the gathering tested positive,” while a smaller number (50.9%) endorsed testing prior to a gathering. Of youth who would not get tested, being vaccinated was the highest reported. Conclusion Youth in our nationwide sample are likely to test for COVID-19 after an event, though less likely if they are vaccinated. Their desire to test is primarily driven by symptoms, exposures, and requirements. Youth are interested in increased access to home testing. Youth-centered communications regarding testing recommendations and increased test availability for youth may reduce COVID-19 spread among young people and inform future pandemic recommendations.",10.1371/journal.pone.0290007,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-3580-9438,55599635700.0,

All rights reserved.Background: People with low income are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17.6% of US adults with T2D experience food insecurity and low diet quality. Low-carbohydrate eating plans can improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and are associated with improved cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality. Little is known about supporting low-carbohydrate eating for people with T2D, although food-as-medicine interventions paired with nutrition education offer a promising solution. Objective: This program aims to support the initiation of dietary changes by using grocery delivery and low-carbohydrate education to increase the quality of low-carbohydrate nutrition among people with T2D and food insecurity. Methods: This program was a nonrandomized pilot conducted at 21 primary care practices in Michigan. Adults with T2D and food insecurity or low income were eligible to enroll. Patients were referred by primary care clinic staff. All participants received the 3-month program, which included monthly US $80 credits for healthy foods, free grocery delivery from Shipt, and low-carbohydrate nutrition education. Food credits were restricted to the purchase of healthy foods. Education materials, developed in collaboration with providers and patients, included print, digital, interactive web, and video formats. At enrollment, participants completed a survey including demographics, diabetes health, diet and physical activity, and diabetes management and knowledge. After the 3-month program, participants completed a survey with repeat assessments of diabetes health, diet and physical activity, and diabetes management and knowledge. Perspectives on participant experience and perceived program impact, food purchasing behaviors, and use of educational materials were also collected. Diabetes health information was supplemented with data from participant medical records. We plan to perform mixed methods analysis to assess program feasibility, acceptability, and impact. Primary quality improvement (QI) measures are the number of patients referred and enrolled, use of US $80 food credits, analysis of food purchasing behavior, participant experience with the program, and program costs. Secondary QI measures include changes in hemoglobin A1c, weight, medications, self-efficacy, diabetes and carbohydrate knowledge, and activity between baseline and follow-up. Results: This program started in October 2022. Data collection is expected to be concluded in June 2024. A total of 151 patients were referred to the program, and 83 (55%) were enrolled. The average age was 57 (SD 13; range 18-86) years, 72% (57/79) were female, 90% (70/78) were White, and 96% (74/77) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity. All participants successfully ordered grocery delivery during the program. Conclusions: This pilot QI program aimed to improve diet quality among people with T2D and food insecurity by using grocery delivery and low-carbohydrate nutrition education. Our findings may help inform the implementation of future QI programs and research studies on food-as-medicine interventions that include grocery delivery and education for people with T2D.

Tammy Chang,Grocery Delivery to Support Healthy Weight Gain Among Pregnant Young Women With Low Income: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,2022.0,JMIR Research Protocols,Article,diet; grocery delivery; pregnancy; weight,"2022 JMIR Publications Inc.. All right reserved.Background: Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with complications for both the mother and her infant including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, operative delivery, and long-term obesity. A healthy diet during pregnancy promotes healthy gestational weight gain and determines fetal epigenetic programming in infants that impacts risk for future chronic disease. Objective: This project will examine the impact of grocery delivery during pregnancy on the weight, diet, and health outcomes of young pregnant women and their infants. Methods: A three-arm randomized controlled trial design will be performed. A total of 855 young pregnant women, aged 14-24 years, from across the state of Michigan will be enrolled and randomized equally into the three study arms. Participants in arm one (control) will receive usual care from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); arm two will receive WIC plus biweekly grocery delivery; and arm three will receive WIC plus biweekly grocery and unsweetened beverage delivery. Weight will be assessed weekly during pregnancy, and total pregnancy weight gain will be categorized as above, below, or within guidelines. Additionally, dietary intake will be assessed at three time points (baseline, second trimester, and third trimester), and pregnancy outcomes will be extracted from medical records. The appropriateness of pregnancy weight gain, diet quality, and occurrence of poor outcomes will be compared between groups using standard practices for multinomial regression and confounder adjustment. Results: This study was funded in April 2021, data collection started in December 2021, and data collection is expected to be concluded in 2026. Conclusions: This study will test whether grocery delivery of healthy foods improves weight, diet, and pregnancy outcomes of young moms with low income. The findings will inform policies and practices that promote a healthy diet during pregnancy, which has multigenerational impacts on health.",10.2196/40568,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-9746-8165,55599635700.0,

In patients with primary amenorrhea, the presence or absence of sexual development should direct the evaluation. Constitutional delay of growth and puberty commonly causes primary amenorrhea in patients with no sexual development. If the patient has normal pubertal development and a uterus, the most common etiology is congenital outflow tract obstruction with a transverse vaginal septum or imperforate hymen. If the patient has abnormal uterine development, müllerian agenesis is the likely cause and a karyotype analysis should confirm that the patient is 46,XX. If a patient has secondary amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. The treatment of primary and secondary amenorrhea is based on the causative factor. Treatment goals include prevention of complications such as osteoporosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and heart disease; preservation of fertility; and, in primary amenorrhea, progression of normal pubertal development.

Such approaches can require significant investment dependent on the development model used. There is little in the literature on the formative assessment of design and development. Better understanding is needed to determine effective methods of training and supporting faculty authors. Methods: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of Web-based modules developed by a Department of Family Medicine in delivering instruction to resident learners and to examine perceptions of the design and development process. Participants included 49 resident learners and 28 faculty and staff members as the development team. Data collection involved use of Web-based surveys, participant observation focus groups, and pretesting/posttesting. Frequency distributions and mean comparisons were used to analyze quantitative data. Participant comments were thematically analyzed. Results: Residents felt that modules met their educational goals and contributed to understanding of core content. Pretest/posttest data showed statistical improvement for a majority of modules. The use of Web authoring software for Web-based learning and scheduling time to work on the modules posed the greatest challenges to module authors. Conclusions: Formative assessment methods can provide important information to module developers and support staff to shape training, content development, and improve module ease of use, navigation, and content for resident learners.",,University of Michigan Medical School,,37054267500.0,

Three successive cohorts of medical students completed both implicit and explicit measures of burnout at several time points during their first two years of medical school. Both assessments were conducted via the internet within a one-week period during the first week of medical school, the end of the first year of medical school, and the end of the second year, though not all cohorts were able to complete the assessments at all time points. Mixed linear models were used to compare the two measures directly, as well as to evaluate changes over time in each measure separately. Minimal correspondence was observed between the implicit and explicit measures of burnout on a within-subject basis. However, when analyzed separately, all subscales of both measures detected significant change over time in the direction of greater levels of burnout, particularly during the first year of medical school. These results provide preliminary evidence the IRAP is able to assess implicit attitudes related to burnout among medical students, though additional research is needed. The IRAP detected consistent improvements in positive implicit attitudes toward medical training during students’ second year of medical school, which was not detected by the MBI. Possible implications of these findings are discussed.",10.1007/s10459-021-10089-0,"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine",0000-0001-5684-4171,7004453625.0,4487947.0

All rights reserved.Background and Objectives: State medical licensing boards are responsible for evaluating physician impairment. Given the stigma generated by mental health issues among physicians and in the medical training culture, we were interested in whether states asked about mental and physical health conditions differently and whether questions focused on current impairment. Methods: Two authors reviewed physician medical licensing applications for US physicians seeking first-time licensing in 2013 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Questions about physical and mental health, as well as substance abuse, were identified and coded as to whether or not they asked about diagnosis and/or treatment or limited the questions to conditions causing physician impairment. RESULTS: Forty-three (84%) states asked questions about mental health conditions, 43 (84%) about physical health conditions, and 47 (92%) about substance use. States were more likely to ask for history of treatment and prior hospitalization for mental health and substance use, compared with physical health disorders. Among states asking about mental health, just 23 (53%) limited all questions to disorders causing functional impairment and just 6 (14%) limited to current problems. Conclusions: While most state medical licensing boards ask about mental health conditions or treatment, only half limited queries to disorders causing impairment. Differences in how state licensing boards assess mental health raise important ethical and legal questions about assessing physician ability to practice and may discourage treatment for physicians who might otherwise benefit from appropriate care.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0001-5684-4171,7004453625.0,

We report on the educational value of the SOC to medical students who volunteer at this clinic. METHODS: The records of all patients seen between August 1, 2012, and July 31, 2013, at the SOC were abstracted on a deidentified basis to collect key demographic and clinical components of the visit, including past medical history, components of the physical exam performed, clinical diagnoses recorded, patient disposition, and medications prescribed. RESULTS: A total of 593 clinic visits were reviewed. Students performed a full physical exam on 80% of patients, primarily for educational purposes. The most frequent diagnoses mapped to a considerable extent to the top diagnoses seen in primary care as well as to the medical school curriculum, and the most frequent medications prescribed mapped to a considerable extent to the pharmacology curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: The SOC provides incremental opportunities for medical students to gain valuable clinical experience during their first 2 years of medical school. The diagnoses encountered and medications prescribed parallel and supplement the medical school curriculum, with a particular focus on primary care. The educational value of these experiences should influence curriculum development and decisions.",,"University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine",0000-0001-5684-4171,7004453625.0,

Methods: One-hundred and ninety physicians in the state of Nevada completed an online survey in spring of 2019 regarding problems with EHRs, their medical practice, social support, and mental health. A parallel mediator model was tested with 10,000 bias-corrected bootstrap samples to assess associations between EHRs and distress directly and indirectly via medical practice problems and social support. Results: Frequency of EHR problems was positively associated with problems with the day-to-day practice of medicine, and negatively associated with access to social support. Medical practice problems were positively associated with physician distress, and social support was negatively associated with it. Mediation analyses suggest that EHR problems indirectly affect physician distress via problems encountered during the practice of medicine and social support. Conclusions: Physician wellbeing is a critical priority for health care. This study suggests that reducing EHR problems may improve physician well-being directly and indirectly by addressing problems in the practice of medicine that compound mental health effects of EHRs.

This study sought to update data on physician suicides in the United States. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) at the Centers for Disease Control collects details about violent deaths. The study used 2010–2015 data from 27 NVDRS states to identify suicide deaths among physicians or non-physicians and calculate annual standardized mortality rates (SMR). Of 63,780 victims total, there were 357 physicians identified over 6 years, (307 men and 50 women). If results are extrapolated to all 50 states, there would be approximately 119 physician suicides annually. The SMR for physicians overall was not statistically different from that of non-physicians. This is the first study in 16 years to update estimated physician suicide rates in the United States. The research used strict criteria to identify physicians so results likely represent the lower boundary of physician suicides. Findings show that physician suicide is not significantly lower than that of non-physicians and emphasizes the importance of focusing on structural changes to reduce stigma around mental health in the medical community.",10.1080/13548506.2021.1903053,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-5684-4171,7004453625.0,8359341.0

Untreated depression is a major risk factor, yet depression stigma presents a barrier to treatment. This study aims to identify early career indications of stigma among physicians-in-training and to inform the design of stigma-reduction programs. Methods A cross-sectional student survey administered at a large, Midwestern medical school in fall 2009 included measures of depression symptoms, attitudes toward mental health, and potential sources of depression stigma. Principal components factor analysis and linear regression were used to examine stigma factors associated with depression in medical students. Results The response rate was 65.7%, with 14.7% students reporting a previous depression diagnosis. Most students indicated that, if depressed, they would feel embarrassed if classmates knew. Many believed that revealing depression could negatively affect professional advancement. Factor analyses revealed three underlying stigma constructs: personal weakness, public devaluation, and social/professional discrimination. Students associating personal weakness with depression perceived medication as less efficacious and the academic environment as more competitive. Those endorsing public stigma viewed medication and counseling as less efficacious and associated depression with an inability to cope. Race, gender, and diagnosis of past/current depression also related to beliefs about stigma. Depression measures most strongly predicted stigma associated with personal weakness and social/professional discrimination. Conclusions Recommendations for decreasing stigma among physicians-in-training include consideration of workplace perceptions, depression etiology, treatment efficacy, and personal attributes in the design of stigma reduction programs that could facilitate help-seeking behavior among physicians throughout their career.",10.1016/j.amepre.2015.03.021,WCU College of Osteopathic Medicine,0000-0001-5684-4171,7004453625.0,

Objective To assess whether direct-to-consumer medical service advertisements provide relevant information on access, quality and cost of care, a content analysis was conducted. Method Television and online advertisements for medical services directly targeting consumers were collected in two major urban centres in Nevada, USA, identifying 313 television advertisements and 200 non-duplicate online advertisements. Results Both television and online advertisements reliably conveyed information about the services provided and how to make an appointment. At the same time, less than half of the advertisements featured insurance information and hours of operation and less than a quarter of them contained information regarding the quality and price of care. The claims of quality were substantiated in even fewer advertisements. The scarcity of quality and cost information was more severe in television advertisements.

Thomas Schwenk,What a medical school chair wants from the dean,2018.0,Journal of Healthcare Leadership,Article,Academic medicine deans; Leadership characteristics; Organizational values; Academic medicine deans; Leadership characteristics; Organizational values,"2018 Hromas et al.Economic pressure has led the evolution of the role of the medical school dean from a clinician educator to a health care system executive. In addition, other dynamic requirements also have likely led to changes in their leadership characteristics. The most important relationship a dean has is with the chairs, yet in the context of the dean’s changing role, little attention has been paid to this relationship. To frame this discussion, we asked medical school chairs what characteristics of a dean’s leadership were most beneficial. We distributed a 26-question survey to 885 clinical and basic science chairs at 41 medical schools. These chairs were confidentially surveyed on their views of six leadership areas: evaluation, barriers to productivity, communication, accountability, crisis management, and organizational values. Of the 491 chairs who responded (response rate =55%), 88% thought that their dean was effective at leading the organization, and 89% enjoyed working with their dean. Chairs indicated that the most important area of expertise of a dean is to define a strategic vision, and the most important value for a dean is integrity between words and deeds. Explaining the reasons behind decisions, providing good feedback, admitting errors, open discussion of complex or awkward topics, and skill in improving relations with the teaching hospital were judged as desirable attributes of a dean. Interestingly, only 23% of chairs want to be a dean in the future. Financial acumen was the least important skill a chair thought a dean should hold, which is in contrast to the skill set for which many deans are hired and evaluated. After reviewing the literature and analyzing these responses, we assert that medical school chairs want their dean to maintain more traditional leadership than that needed by a health care system executive, such as articulating a vision for the future and keeping their promises. Thus, there appears to be a mismatch between what medical school chairs perceive they need from their dean and how the success of a dean is evaluated.",10.2147/JHL.S158937,Joe R. &amp; Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine,0000-0001-5684-4171,7004453625.0,

When it comes to medical education, the process of getting involved may seem especially mysterious and intimidating. At the same time, the unique competencies that psychologists possess, including their expertise in research, human diversity, the patient-provider relationship, and the psychosocial dimension of illness, can add significant value to the training of competent and compassionate physicians. This article brings together the perspectives of four practicing health service psychologists, one academic psychologist, and one psychiatrist, each of whom has had a significant role in a medical education setting. The authors use their personal examples and illustrations from their own professional journeys to identify potential access points into graduate medical education. They offer practical advice for getting involved, highlighting the importance of owning one’s expertise, respecting the expertise of other disciplines, seeking out interprofessional collaborations, and saying “yes” to new opportunities when they arise.

The family physician often is the first to be approached by parents regarding learning delays in children. The initial evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination for medical conditions and mental disorders that may manifest as or coexist with learning disabilities. Physicians should advise parents to request that the child's school administer tests for learning disabilities. Physicians should be aware of common tests used to assess for learning disabilities, understand the laws that support provision of special education, and recognize the main categories of learning disabilities.

We tested differences between in-person and virtual interviews for significance using χ2 tests. RESULTS: There were significant differences in factors influencing a candi-date’s decision to apply. Candidates who participated in virtual interviews were more interested in urban training settings, a community setting, and obstetrical training compared with the in-person interview cohort. Nearly 50% of virtual candidates reported preferring virtual interviews in the future. There were no significant differences in how candidates rated their experience of the interview process and they indicated adequate contact with resident per-sonnel despite a transition to virtual interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to virtual recruitment has been well received by candidates, as indicated by the high positive ratings of the cohorts. The transition has not resulted in a negative impact on the recruitment experience or the ability to meet with resident leadership.",10.22454/fammed.2022.510274,Michigan Medicine,,59268618300.0,

That year began with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, then moved through the largest single day drop of the Dow Jones industrial average, the murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and subsequent Black Lives Matter protests, murder hornets, the election of Joe Biden, alleged voter fraud, and then culminated on January 6, 2021, with the assault on the United States Capital Building. Societal issues including racism, discrimination, and distrust of leaders have been themes in the news and social media. It should come as no surprise that we may be called upon to provide treatment to patients with whom we have significantly different belief systems, which could result in conflict. The emotional rawness that pervades much of society lays emotions bare for many. Our ethical responsibilities as healthcare providers compel us to think about these complex relationships intentionally, and with compassion. In an interactive workshop conducted at the 42nd Forum for Behavioral Science in Family Medicine, participants were led through scenarios in which conflict could enter the exam room, discussion of the potential consequences, and consideration of ways to respond ethically in those situations. The discussions were couched in the codes of ethics of the American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, and the American Medical Association. The interactive session was designed to encourage participants to (1) consider potentialities of patient-provider conflict, (2) consider ethical, compassionate responses, and (3) be mindful of social media.",10.1177/00912174221112830,The University of Alabama System,,59268618300.0,
Thomas Ward Bishop,Getting involved in training the next generation of physicians: Examples of practicing psychologists in psychiatry and family medicine residency programs.,2021.0,Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,Article,family medicine residency; medical education; physician training; psychiatry residency; psychologist,"2021 American Psychological AssociationMany practicing psychologists enjoy being involved in training, but clear opportunities for such involvement are not always apparent. When it comes to medical education, the process of getting involved may seem especially mysterious and intimidating. At the same time, the unique competencies that psychologists possess, including their expertise in research, human diversity, the patient-provider relationship, and the psychosocial dimension of illness, can add significant value to the training of competent and compassionate physicians. This article brings together the perspectives of four practicing health service psychologists, one academic psychologist, and one psychiatrist, each of whom has had a significant role in a medical education setting. The authors use their personal examples and illustrations from their own professional journeys to identify potential access points into graduate medical education. They offer practical advice for getting involved, highlighting the importance of owning one’s expertise, respecting the expertise of other disciplines, seeking out interprofessional collaborations, and saying “yes” to new opportunities when they arise.

Timothy C Gueetterman,Implementing integrated hypertension and diabetes management using the World Health Organization’s HEARTS model: protocol for a pilot study in the Guatemalan national primary care system,2024.0,Implementation Science Communications,Article,Diabetes; Global health; Guatemala; Health policy and systems research; Hypertension; Implementation research; WHO HEARTS technical package,"2024, The Author(s).Background: The HEARTS technical package was developed by the World Health Organization to address the implementation gap in cardiovascular disease prevention in low- and middle-income countries. Guatemala is a middle-income country that is currently implementing HEARTS. National authorities in Guatemala are interested in exploring how hypertension and diabetes management can be integrated in HEARTS implementation. The objective of this study is to conduct a feasibility and acceptability pilot trial of integrated hypertension and diabetes management based on HEARTS in the publicly funded primary care system in Guatemala. Methods: A single-arm pilot trial for 6 months will be carried out in 11 Ministry of Health primary care facilities starting in September 2023. A planned sample of 100 adult patients diagnosed with diabetes (n = 45), hypertension (n = 45), or both (n = 10) will be enrolled. The intervention will consist of HEARTS-aligned components: Training health workers on healthy-lifestyle counseling and evidence-based treatment protocols, strengthening access to medications and diagnostics, training on risk-based cardiovascular disease management, team-based care and task sharing, and systems monitoring and feedback, including implementation of a facility-based electronic monitoring tool at the individual level. Co-primary outcomes of feasibility and acceptability will be assessed using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. Secondary outcomes include clinical effectiveness (treatment with medication, glycemic control, and blood pressure control), key implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, usability, and sustainability), and patient-reported outcome measures (diabetes distress, disability, and treatment burden). Using an implementation mapping approach, a Technical Advisory Committee will develop implementation strategies for subsequent scale-up planning. Discussion: This trial will produce evidence on implementing HEARTS-aligned hypertension and diabetes care in the MOH primary care system in Guatemala. Results also will inform future HEARTS projects in Guatemala and other low- and middle-income countries. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06080451.

Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Purpose: High-quality communication is essential to patient-centered care. Existing communication models and research tends to focus on what is said verbally with little attention to nonverbal aspects of communication. In sensitive and emotionally intensive healthcare encounters, such as in cancer care, provider and patient nonverbal behavior may be particularly important for communicating with empathy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a conceptual model of communication that accounts for nonverbal behavior. Methods: We followed a systematic grounded theory design that involved semi-structured interviews with 23 providers, including nurse practitioners, physicians, surgeons, and physician's assistants. Using constant comparative analysis, we analyzed transcripts and developed a grounded theory model of communication accounting for nonverbal behavior. Results: The major themes included building rapport, gauging how patients will take bad news, ensuring patients' understanding of their conditions, staying honest but hopeful, centering but guiding patient through cancer care, conveying empathy while managing heightened emotions, and ensuring patient understanding. Throughout the process, providers synthesize both verbal and nonverbal information and apply what they learn to future encounters. Conclusions: The results extend existing models of patient-centered communication and invite communication intervention and research that incorporates nonverbal behavior. The model contributes an understanding of the full process of communication in clinical encounters.",10.1002/cam4.70010,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

However, the quality and rigour of mixed methods research proposals and publications often miss opportunities for integration, which is the core of mixed methods. Achieving integration remains challenging, and failing to integrate reduces the benefits of a mixed methods approach. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to guide quality and safety researchers in planning and designing a mixed methods study that facilitates integration. We highlight how meaningful integration in mixed methods research can be achieved by centring integration at the following levels: research question, design, methods, results and reporting and interpretation levels.

Methods: Using 2008–2016 Medicare and commercial claims data, we compared adults with the same disability enrolled in TM vs. commercial insurance [Medicare: n = 21,599 (CP/SB); n = 7,605 (MS); n = 4,802 (TSCI); commercial: n = 11,306 (CP/SB); n = 6,254 (MS); n = 5,265 (TSCI)]. We applied generalized estimating equations to address repeated measures, comparing cases with controls. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. Results: Compared with commercial insurance, enrolling in TM reduced the odds of using preventive services. For example, adjusted odds ratios (OR) of annual wellness visits in TM vs. commercial insurance were 0.31 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28–0.34), 0.32 (95% CI: 0.28–0.37), and 0.19 (95% CI: 0.17–0.22) among adults with CP/SB, TSCI, and MS, respectively. Furthermore, PPH risks were higher in TM vs. commercial insurance. ORs of PPH in TM vs. commercial insurance were 1.50 (95% CI: 1.18–1.89), 1.83 (95% CI: 1.40–2.41), and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.66–3.22) among adults with CP/SB, TSCI, and MS, respectively. Moreover, dual-eligible adults had higher odds of PPH compared with non-dual-eligible adults [CP/SB: OR = 1.47 (95% CI: 1.25–1.72); TSCI: OR = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.35–1.92), and MS: OR = 1.80 (95% CI: 1.55–2.10)].

Timothy C Gueetterman,“Better at home”: Mixed methods report of intricacies in pediatric febrile neutropenia management,2024.0,Cancer Medicine,Article,cancer; care delivery; children; hospital discharge; infectious disease; qualitative,"2024 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Introduction: Many febrile neutropenia (FN) episodes are low risk (LR) for severe outcomes and can safely receive less aggressive management and early hospital discharge. Validated risk tools are recommended by the Children's Oncology Group to identify LR FN episodes. However, the complex dynamics of early hospital discharge and burdens faced by caregivers associated with the FN episode have been inadequately described. Methods: An adapted quality-of-life (QoL) survey instrument was administered by a convergent mixed methods design; qualitative and quantitative data from two sources, the medical record and the mixed methods survey instrument, were independently analyzed prior to linkage and integration. Code book was informed by conceptual framework; open coding was used. Mixed methods analysis used joint display of results to determine meta-inferences. Results: Twenty-eight patient–caregiver dyads participated with a response rate of 87%. Of the 27 FN episodes, 51.8% (14/27) were LR and 40.7% (11/27) had an early hospital discharge. The LR and early hospital discharge groups had higher mean QoL scores comparatively. Meta-inferences are reciprocal influencers and expand the complex situation; FN negatively affects the entire family, and the benefits of hospital management were outweighed by risks and worsened symptoms, so an individualized approach to management and care at home was preferred. Conclusion: Early discharge of LR FN episodes positively impacts QoL, yet risk-stratified management for FN is intricately complex. Optimal FN management should prioritize the patient's overall health; shared decision-making is recommended and can improve care delivery. These results should be confirmed in a larger, more heterogeneous population.",10.1002/cam4.7106,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

This study sought to: 1) explore variation in the role of police in OHCA across emergency medical systems and 2) identify factors influencing this variation. Methods: We conducted a qualitative multisite case study analysis using data collected through semi-structured key informant interviews and multidisciplinary focus groups with telecommunicators, fire, police, emergency medical services, and hospital personnel across nine Michigan emergency systems of care. Sites were sampled based on return of spontaneous circulation rates, trauma region, geography, rurality, and population density. Data were analyzed to examine police role in OHCA and the organizational factors that contribute to these roles. Transcripts and coded data were explored using iterative thematic analysis and matrices. Results: Interviews included approximately 160 public safety informants of varying administrative levels (i.e., field staff, mid-level managers, and leadership). Across systems, police played four on-scene roles in OHCA response: 1) early responder, 2) resuscitation team member, 3) security, and 4) information gathering. Less consistently, police performed supplementary roles as telecommunicators and cardiac arrest educators. We found that factors including administrative structure of the police agency, resources (e.g., human and material), organizational culture, medical training, deployment and response policies, nature of response environment, and relationships with other prehospital stakeholders contributed to the degree certain roles were present. Conclusions: Police serve numerous on-scene and supplementary roles in OHCA response across jurisdictions. Their roles were influenced by multiple factors at each site. Future studies may help to better understand the value of and how to optimize police engagement in OHCA response.",10.1080/10903127.2024.2397534,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

Yet, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial and meta-analyses confirm that few patients benefit and that visual benefit is of questionable clinical significance, short-lived, and comes with potential harms. The purpose of this study was to uncover the breadth of factors that underlie clinicians' treatment decisions and determine how these factors may influence corticosteroid use for I/MS-ON.Methods:We performed semistructured, one-on-one, qualitative interviews with neurologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, and emergency department clinicians at 15 academic and private practices across the United States. The interview guide used the Theoretical Domain Framework and a vignette to explore numerous factors that might influence decision making for definite I/MS-ON. We analyzed transcripts using inductive thematic analysis to generate themes.Results:A total of 22 clinicians were interviewed before thematic saturation was reached: 8 neuro-ophthalmologists, 8 neurologists, and 6 emergency medicine (EM) clinicians (2 physician assistants, 4 physicians). All neuro-ophthalmologists and nearly all neurologists (7 of 8) were aware of risks/benefits of corticosteroid treatment for I/MS-ON. However, neuro-ophthalmologists varied in their corticosteroid treatment recommendation (n = 3 recommended treatment, n = 2 recommended observation, n = 3 recommended shared decision making), whereas all neurologists recommended corticosteroids, indicating that knowledge of corticosteroid risk/benefit alone does not drive decision making. EM clinicians were not aware of risk/benefits of corticosteroid treatment for I/MS-ON and relied on the treatment recommendations of neurologists. Clinicians recommending corticosteroids held personal beliefs that corticosteroids benefit those with worse vision loss, relieve pain, allow earlier return to work, or have easily mitigated side effects. They also perceived that prescribing steroid was the principal method of ""doing something,""which fit a key provider role. Clinicians who did not recommend corticosteroids or were neutral perceived the risks as nontrivial, considered discussing treatment trade-offs as ""doing something""and incorporated patient preferences.Conclusions:Knowledge of risk/benefits of corticosteroids are necessary but not sufficient for evidence-based I/MS-ON practice. Variation in how clinicians treat patients with acute I/MS-ON is influenced largely by psychosocial factors, such as beliefs about corticosteroid risk/benefit trade-offs and the role of the clinician to provide treatment. Interventions to support evidence-based decision making for I/MS-ON treatment will need to provide risk/benefit information to support clinicians with varying levels of expertise, incorporate patient preference, and normalize the option to observe.",10.1097/WNO.0000000000002219,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

We aimed to explore participants' experiences of a peer health-coached resilience-building energy management to enhance well-being (RENEW) intervention on symptoms and well-being and to use mixed methods to compare how SSc duration influenced the experiences of participants who had clinically significant fatigue improvement vs those who did not. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 participants from the parent clinical trial randomized to the RENEW intervention. Data were analysed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique combined with thematic content analysis. A mixed methods approach used a joint display to identify themes related to the impact of SSc duration on fatigue improvement status. Participants were categorized into short/improvement, short/limited improvement, long/improvement, and long/limited improvement. Results: Our team generated four themes: participant and peer health-coach relationship, physical and psychological well-being improvement, need for a tailored approach and easy program access through technology. Mixed methods analysis revealed that, regardless of SSc duration, participants with improved fatigue reported increasing self-awareness of SSc-related symptoms and learning coping strategies to manage fatigue. Participants in the short/improvement group reported preferences for slower pacing of the program and pairing with a coach with similar symptom severity. Participants in the long/limited improvement group sought SSc-specific symptom management information. Conclusion: Incorporating peer health coaches and technology is beneficial for self-management interventions for people with SSc.

Despite an increase in techniques to facilitate integration at the methods and reporting levels, there is less practical guidance on how to conduct mixed methods integrative data analysis. Qualitative data analysis software is rapidly advancing to facilitate integrative analysis in mixed methods research studies. However, examples on how these features support analysis are relatively limited. The purpose of this article is to promote the use of qualitative data analysis software for integrative analysis in mixed methods research by describing the value of the major features available in software (i.e., code queries, crosstabulations, and quote matrices).

No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Curriculum development is a topic everyone in the field of medical education will encounter. Due to the breadth of ages and types of care provided in Family Medicine, family medicine faculty in particular need to be facile in developing effective curricula for medical students, residents, fellows and for faculty development. In the area of medical education, changing and evolving learning environments, as well as changing requirements necessitate new and innovative curricula to address these evolving needs. The process of developing a medical education curriculum can seem daunting but when broken down into smaller components can become very straightforward and easy to accomplish. This paper focuses on the curriculum development process using a six-step approach: performing a needs assessment, determining content, writing goals and objectives, selecting the educational strategies, implementing the curriculum and, finally, evaluating the curriculum.

We describe the development of a self-rated mixed methods skills assessment and provide validity evidence. The instrument taps six research domains: “Research question,” “Design/approach,” “Sampling,” “Data collection,” “Analysis,” and “Dissemination.” Respondents are asked to rate their ability to define or explain concepts of mixed methods under each domain, their ability to apply the concepts to problems, and the extent to which they need to improve. Methods: We administered the questionnaire to 145 faculty and students using an internet survey. We analyzed descriptive statistics and performance characteristics of the questionnaire using the Cronbach alpha to assess reliability and an analysis of variance that compared a mixed methods experience index with assessment scores to assess criterion relatedness. Results: Internal consistency reliability was high for the total set of items (0.95) and adequate (≥0.71) for all but one subscale. Consistent with establishing criterion validity, respondents who had more professional experiences with mixed methods (eg, published a mixed methods article) rated themselves as more skilled, which was statistically significant across the research domains. Discussion: This self-rated mixed methods assessment instrument may be a useful tool to assess skills in mixed methods for training programs. It can be applied widely at the graduate and faculty level. For the learner, assessment may lead to enhanced motivation to learn and training focused on self-identified needs. For faculty, the assessment may improve curriculum and course content planning.",10.1097/CEH.0000000000000152,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-5006-880X,7004007865.0,

Yet, the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial and meta-analyses confirm that few patients benefit and that visual benefit is of questionable clinical significance, short-lived, and comes with potential harms. The purpose of this study was to uncover the breadth of factors that underlie clinicians' treatment decisions and determine how these factors may influence corticosteroid use for I/MS-ON.Methods:We performed semistructured, one-on-one, qualitative interviews with neurologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, and emergency department clinicians at 15 academic and private practices across the United States. The interview guide used the Theoretical Domain Framework and a vignette to explore numerous factors that might influence decision making for definite I/MS-ON. We analyzed transcripts using inductive thematic analysis to generate themes.Results:A total of 22 clinicians were interviewed before thematic saturation was reached: 8 neuro-ophthalmologists, 8 neurologists, and 6 emergency medicine (EM) clinicians (2 physician assistants, 4 physicians). All neuro-ophthalmologists and nearly all neurologists (7 of 8) were aware of risks/benefits of corticosteroid treatment for I/MS-ON. However, neuro-ophthalmologists varied in their corticosteroid treatment recommendation (n = 3 recommended treatment, n = 2 recommended observation, n = 3 recommended shared decision making), whereas all neurologists recommended corticosteroids, indicating that knowledge of corticosteroid risk/benefit alone does not drive decision making. EM clinicians were not aware of risk/benefits of corticosteroid treatment for I/MS-ON and relied on the treatment recommendations of neurologists. Clinicians recommending corticosteroids held personal beliefs that corticosteroids benefit those with worse vision loss, relieve pain, allow earlier return to work, or have easily mitigated side effects. They also perceived that prescribing steroid was the principal method of ""doing something,""which fit a key provider role. Clinicians who did not recommend corticosteroids or were neutral perceived the risks as nontrivial, considered discussing treatment trade-offs as ""doing something""and incorporated patient preferences.Conclusions:Knowledge of risk/benefits of corticosteroids are necessary but not sufficient for evidence-based I/MS-ON practice. Variation in how clinicians treat patients with acute I/MS-ON is influenced largely by psychosocial factors, such as beliefs about corticosteroid risk/benefit trade-offs and the role of the clinician to provide treatment. Interventions to support evidence-based decision making for I/MS-ON treatment will need to provide risk/benefit information to support clinicians with varying levels of expertise, incorporate patient preference, and normalize the option to observe.",10.1097/WNO.0000000000002219,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

The focused goal was to evaluate online training by comparing the self-rated skills of scholars who experienced an in-person retreat to scholars in an online retreat in specific domains of mixed methods research for the health sciences from 2015–2023. Methods: The authors administered a scholar Mixed Methods Skills Self-Assessment instrument based on an educational competency scale that included domains on: “research questions,” “design/approach,” “sampling,” “analysis,” and “dissemination” to participants of the Mixed Methods Research Training Program for the Health Sciences (MMRTP). Self-ratings on confidence on domains were compared before and after retreat participation within cohorts who attended in person (n = 73) or online (n = 57) as well as comparing across in-person to online cohorts. Responses to open-ended questions about experiences with the retreat were analyzed. Results: Scholars in an interactive program to improve mixed methods skills reported significantly increased confidence in ability to define or explain concepts and in ability to apply the concepts to practical problems, whether the program was attended in-person or synchronously online. Scholars in the online retreat had self-rated skill improvements as good or better than scholars who participated in person. With the possible exception of networking, scholars found the online format was associated with advantages such as accessibility and reduced burden of travel and finding childcare. No differences in difficulty of learning concepts was described. Conclusions: Keeping in mind that the retreat is only one component of the MMRTP, this study provides evidence that mixed methods training online was associated with the same increases in self-rated skills as persons attending online and can be a key component to increasing the capacity for mixed methods research in the health sciences.",10.1186/s12909-024-05877-2,Johns Hopkins University,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,7948561.0

However, the quality and rigour of mixed methods research proposals and publications often miss opportunities for integration, which is the core of mixed methods. Achieving integration remains challenging, and failing to integrate reduces the benefits of a mixed methods approach. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to guide quality and safety researchers in planning and designing a mixed methods study that facilitates integration. We highlight how meaningful integration in mixed methods research can be achieved by centring integration at the following levels: research question, design, methods, results and reporting and interpretation levels. A holistic view of integration through all these levels will enable researchers to provide better answers to complex problems and thereby contribute to improvement of safety and quality of care.",10.1136/bmjqs-2023-016112,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,7948561.0

We used a qualitative approach to determine types of feedback standardized registered nurses (SRN) can provide to students pre-residency. Senior medical students enrolled in an elective one-month specialty-specific Residency Preparation Course in 2018 participated in a simulated paging curriculum where they responded to urgent pages from SRNs about mock patients. The SRNs followed a script and assessed students using a rubric, then provided immediate verbal feedback on the students’ clinical management and communication skills. We recorded, de-identified, transcribed, and coded feedback, then determined themes. Seventy-six students participated and 162 encounters were recorded. We developed nine codes and identified two themes: positive reinforcement and authentic clinical feedback. The SRNs connected the cases to real-life experiences, reflecting upon mistakes or interactions they have made, to emphasize learning points for the student. This non-scripted, authentic clinical feedback reinforced the feedback provided on specific domains including information gathering, communication, and clinical management.

We aimed to explore participants' experiences of a peer health-coached resilience-building energy management to enhance well-being (RENEW) intervention on symptoms and well-being and to use mixed methods to compare how SSc duration influenced the experiences of participants who had clinically significant fatigue improvement vs those who did not. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 participants from the parent clinical trial randomized to the RENEW intervention. Data were analysed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction technique combined with thematic content analysis. A mixed methods approach used a joint display to identify themes related to the impact of SSc duration on fatigue improvement status. Participants were categorized into short/improvement, short/limited improvement, long/improvement, and long/limited improvement. Results: Our team generated four themes: participant and peer health-coach relationship, physical and psychological well-being improvement, need for a tailored approach and easy program access through technology. Mixed methods analysis revealed that, regardless of SSc duration, participants with improved fatigue reported increasing self-awareness of SSc-related symptoms and learning coping strategies to manage fatigue. Participants in the short/improvement group reported preferences for slower pacing of the program and pairing with a coach with similar symptom severity. Participants in the long/limited improvement group sought SSc-specific symptom management information. Conclusion: Incorporating peer health coaches and technology is beneficial for self-management interventions for people with SSc.

Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Purpose: High-quality communication is essential to patient-centered care. Existing communication models and research tends to focus on what is said verbally with little attention to nonverbal aspects of communication. In sensitive and emotionally intensive healthcare encounters, such as in cancer care, provider and patient nonverbal behavior may be particularly important for communicating with empathy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a conceptual model of communication that accounts for nonverbal behavior. Methods: We followed a systematic grounded theory design that involved semi-structured interviews with 23 providers, including nurse practitioners, physicians, surgeons, and physician's assistants. Using constant comparative analysis, we analyzed transcripts and developed a grounded theory model of communication accounting for nonverbal behavior. Results: The major themes included building rapport, gauging how patients will take bad news, ensuring patients' understanding of their conditions, staying honest but hopeful, centering but guiding patient through cancer care, conveying empathy while managing heightened emotions, and ensuring patient understanding. Throughout the process, providers synthesize both verbal and nonverbal information and apply what they learn to future encounters. Conclusions: The results extend existing models of patient-centered communication and invite communication intervention and research that incorporates nonverbal behavior. The model contributes an understanding of the full process of communication in clinical encounters.",10.1002/cam4.70010,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,7948561.0

This study sought to: 1) explore variation in the role of police in OHCA across emergency medical systems and 2) identify factors influencing this variation. Methods: We conducted a qualitative multisite case study analysis using data collected through semi-structured key informant interviews and multidisciplinary focus groups with telecommunicators, fire, police, emergency medical services, and hospital personnel across nine Michigan emergency systems of care. Sites were sampled based on return of spontaneous circulation rates, trauma region, geography, rurality, and population density. Data were analyzed to examine police role in OHCA and the organizational factors that contribute to these roles. Transcripts and coded data were explored using iterative thematic analysis and matrices. Results: Interviews included approximately 160 public safety informants of varying administrative levels (i.e., field staff, mid-level managers, and leadership). Across systems, police played four on-scene roles in OHCA response: 1) early responder, 2) resuscitation team member, 3) security, and 4) information gathering. Less consistently, police performed supplementary roles as telecommunicators and cardiac arrest educators. We found that factors including administrative structure of the police agency, resources (e.g., human and material), organizational culture, medical training, deployment and response policies, nature of response environment, and relationships with other prehospital stakeholders contributed to the degree certain roles were present. Conclusions: Police serve numerous on-scene and supplementary roles in OHCA response across jurisdictions. Their roles were influenced by multiple factors at each site.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Primary care patients with obesity seldom receive effective weight management treatment in primary care settings. This study aims to understand PCPs’ perspectives on obesity treatment barriers and opportunities to overcome them. Study design This is an explanatory sequential mixed methods study in which survey data was collected and used to inform subsequent qualitative interviews. Settings and participants PCPs who provide care to adult patients in an academic medical center in the Midwestern US. Methodology PCPs (n = 350) were invited by email to participate in an online survey. PCPs were subsequently invited to participate in semi-structured interviews to further explore survey domains. Analytic approach Survey data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis. Results Among 107 survey respondents, less than 10% (n = 8) used evidence-based guidelines to inform obesity treatment decisions. PCPs’ identified opportunities to improve obesity treatment including (1) education on local obesity treatment resources (n = 78, 73%), evidence-based dietary counseling strategies (n = 67, 63%), and effective self-help resources (n = 75, 70%) and (2) enhanced team-based care with support from clinic staff (n = 53, 46%), peers trained in obesity medicine (n = 47, 44%), and dietitians (n = 58, 54%). PCPs also desired increased reimbursement for obesity treatment. While 40% (n = 39) of survey respondents expressed interest in obesity medicine training and certification through the American Board of Obesity Medicine, qualitative interviewees felt that pursuing training would require dedicated time (i.e., reduced clinical effort) and financial support. Conclusions Opportunities to improve obesity treatment in primary care settings include educational initiatives, use of team-based care models, and policy changes to incentivize obesity treatment. Primary care clinics or health systems should be encouraged to identify PCPs with specific interests in obesity medicine and support their training and certification through ABOM by reimbursing training costs and reducing clinical effort to allow for study and board examination.",10.1371/journal.pone.0284474,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0001-7134-970X,6506260840.0,

From family physicians’ perspectives, this shift to virtual care has the potential to affect workflow, job satisfaction, and patient communication. As clinics reopened and care delivery models shifted to a combination of in-person and virtual care, the need to understand physician experiences with virtual care arose in order to improve both patient and provider experiences. This study investigated Michigan Medicine family medicine physicians’ perceptions of virtual care through qualitative interviews to better understand how to improve the quality and effectiveness of virtual care for both patients and physicians. Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive design to examine physician perspectives through semistructured interviews. We coded and analyzed transcripts using thematic analysis, facilitated by MAXQDA (VERBI) software. Results: The results of the analysis identified four major themes: (a) chief concerns that are appropriate for virtual evaluation, (b) physician perceptions of patient benefits, (c) focused but contextually enriched patient-physician communication, and (d) structural support needed for high-quality virtual care. Conclusions: These findings can help further direct the discussion of how to make use of resources to improve the quality and effectiveness of virtual care.",10.22454/FamMed.2024.592756,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Introduction: Many febrile neutropenia (FN) episodes are low risk (LR) for severe outcomes and can safely receive less aggressive management and early hospital discharge. Validated risk tools are recommended by the Children's Oncology Group to identify LR FN episodes. However, the complex dynamics of early hospital discharge and burdens faced by caregivers associated with the FN episode have been inadequately described. Methods: An adapted quality-of-life (QoL) survey instrument was administered by a convergent mixed methods design; qualitative and quantitative data from two sources, the medical record and the mixed methods survey instrument, were independently analyzed prior to linkage and integration. Code book was informed by conceptual framework; open coding was used. Mixed methods analysis used joint display of results to determine meta-inferences. Results: Twenty-eight patient–caregiver dyads participated with a response rate of 87%. Of the 27 FN episodes, 51.8% (14/27) were LR and 40.7% (11/27) had an early hospital discharge. The LR and early hospital discharge groups had higher mean QoL scores comparatively. Meta-inferences are reciprocal influencers and expand the complex situation; FN negatively affects the entire family, and the benefits of hospital management were outweighed by risks and worsened symptoms, so an individualized approach to management and care at home was preferred. Conclusion: Early discharge of LR FN episodes positively impacts QoL, yet risk-stratified management for FN is intricately complex. Optimal FN management should prioritize the patient's overall health; shared decision-making is recommended and can improve care delivery. These results should be confirmed in a larger, more heterogeneous population.",10.1002/cam4.7106,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0093-858X,56652174000.0,

In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) to examine human health and functioning. To use the ICF in clinical practice, smaller categories of ICF codes, referred to as Core Sets, were developed for specific health conditions. However, no ICF Core Set exists for deafblindness. As part of an ICF Core Set development, this paper examines the existing literature from an ICF perspective and links relevant data to the ICF categories. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Articles were selected from eight scientific databases, three journals, and Google Scholar. The research team linked outcome measures and qualitative studies to ICF codes using ICF linking rules. For each measure/qualitative study’s final code list, they included each code only once after eliminating any duplicates. Subsequently, a frequency analysis was conducted, and ICF categories identified in at least five studies were included in the candidate categories list. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 147 articles met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were from Europe (N.=70) and North America (N.=41). 316 categories were identified in at least five studies that belong to one of four ICF components. This includes 112 categories in the body function component, 3 categories in body structure, 163 in activities and participation, and 38 in environmental factors. Additionally, 21 personal factors relating to demographics were identified. The most frequent category was listening (category d115) at 82.31%, followed by range of emotions (category b1522) at 78.91%, hearing function (category b230) at 68.03%, and assistive products and technology for communication (category e1251) at 63.27%. CONCLUSIONS: As the second part of the first four studies in developing ICF Core Sets for deafblindness, this review described the ICF categories relevant to the functioning of individuals with deafblindness. These categories inform the development of the Core Sets on deafblindness from the researcher’s perspective. The final Core Sets will guide clinical practice, programs, and policies for individuals with deafblindness.",10.23736/S1973-9087.24.07984-X,University of Montreal,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,
Tyler G James,Cesarean birth and adverse birth outcomes among sub-populations of deaf and hard-of-hearing people,2024.0,Disability and Health Journal,Article,Communication; Deaf and hard-of-hearing; Obstetrics; Pregnancy,"2024 Elsevier Inc.Background: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people are at higher risk than their non-DHH counterparts of experiencing adverse birth outcomes. There is a lack of research focusing on social, linguistic, and medical factors related to being DHH which may identify groups of DHH people who experience more inequity. Objective: Examine difference in prevalence of cesarean and adverse birth outcomes among diverse sub-groups of DHH people. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of DHH birthing people in the U.S. who gave birth within the past 10 years. The sample was predominantly white, college educated, and married. We assessed cesarean birth and three adverse birth outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, and NICU admission post-delivery. DHH-specific variables were genetic etiology of hearing loss, preferred language (i.e., American Sign Language, English, or bilingual), severity of hearing loss, age of onset of hearing loss, and self-reported quality of perinatal care communication. We estimated prevalence, 95 % confidence intervals, and unadjusted prevalence ratios. Results: Thirty-one percent of our sample reported a cesarean birth. Overall, there were no significant differences in prevalence across the outcome variables with respect to preferred language, genetic etiology, severity, and age of onset. Poorer perinatal care communication quality was associated with higher prevalence of preterm birth (PR = 2.37) and NICU admission (PR = 1.91). Conclusions: Our study found no evidence supporting differences in obstetric outcomes among DHH birthing people across medical factors related to deafness. Findings support the important role of communication access for DHH people in healthcare environments.",10.1016/j.dhjo.2024.101639,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

In this population, intersectional inequities lead to adverse health outcomes for both those individuals and the companion animals they care for. Community-based veterinary clinics provide an opportunity to target these inequities from a culturally sensitive lens, intending to improve human and animal outcomes. We conducted a process evaluation of a student-led community-based clinic for this population to better understand client satisfaction, assess learning outcomes among veterinary students, and improve program delivery and services. During academic year 2020–2021, the monthly clinics had 162 appointments in total with a median 15 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) candidates volunteering at each clinic. Clients and volunteers responded to survey questionnaires designed to elicit information about their experiences with the clinic, including open-ended questions for further elucidation of measurable indicators of client-, patient-, and student-level impact. Clients attributed enrollment in the clinic with improved quality-of-life and reduction of financial burden; the program saved clients approximately $2,050 per pet during the evaluation year. Furthermore, the clinic widely facilitated completion of the college’s core Primary Care and Dentistry learning outcomes. Beyond curriculum-standard learning objectives, students also reported positive attitude changes and increased readiness to provide care to people with disabilities and people experiencing low socioeconomic position. The results of this evaluation have significant implications for both veterinary and public health pedagogy. Especially, they highlight the significance of community health practice in veterinary trainee education.",10.3138/jvme-2023-0032,VCA Animal Hospitals,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,
Tyler G James,Qualitative Thematic Analysis in a Mixed Methods Study: Guidelines and Considerations for Integration,2024.0,Journal of Mixed Methods Research,Article,integration; qualitative analysis; thematic analysis,"The Author(s) 2024.Qualitative thematic analysis is a commonly used and widely applicable form of qualitative analysis, though it can be challenging to implement. Due to its use across research questions, qualitative traditions, and fields, thematic analysis is also prevalent in mixed methods studies. Despite its widespread use, the term “thematic analysis” is often confused and not always well described in empirical studies. In addition, there is limited guidance on how to use thematic analysis within the context of mixed methods research to ensure rigorous study design and mixed methods integration.

The current investigation examined sexual decision-making in the context of PrEP among young adult men who have sex with men (MSM) between 18 and 30 years old, using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. For the quantitative aim, 99 MSM currently taking PrEP (i.e., PrEP-experienced) and 140 MSM not currently taking PrEP (i.e., PrEP-naive) completed an online survey, including the Sexual Delay Discounting Task (SDDT), which captures likelihood of condom use. For the qualitative aim, 15 people from each group were interviewed about their (1) conceptualizations of risky sex and (2) ways they manage their sexual risk. Participants were, on average, 25.69 years old (SD = 3.07) and 64% White. Results from the quantitative aim revealed, controlling for covariates, PrEP-experienced participants exhibited significantly lower likelihood of (1) using an immediately available condom and (2) waiting for a delayed condom (i.e., sexual delay discounting) compared to PrEP-naive participants. Qualitative themes explaining what young adult MSM consider to be risky sex included: (1) any sex as risky sex, (2) risky sex as “sex without a conversation,” and (3) risky sex as sex with risk for physical harm. Themes on ways young adult MSM manage sexual risk were classified as proactive, reactive, and passive. Results suggest that PrEP use is related to condom use decisions. Taken together, quantitative differences in sexual delay discounting, but qualitatively similar conceptualizations and management of risky sex, suggest that the SDDT may be a useful tool in sex research to capture processes (i.e., delay discounting) underlying sexual decision-making that may be missed by traditional self-reports. Implications of results, including potentially providing (good quality) condoms with every PrEP prescription, and future research topics are discussed.",10.1007/s10508-024-02822-8,Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Journal of Intellectual Disability Research published by MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, HIV diagnosis and receipt of HIV care among adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) who are publicly insured in the USA. Design: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of Medicare–Medicaid linked data of adults with IDD who were publicly insured in 2012 (n = 878 186). Methods: We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios of HIV testing, diagnosis and receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We also identified the relationship between predisposing (age, gender, race and ethnicity), enabling (Medicare, Medicaid or both; rural status; geographical location; and county income) and need-related characteristics (IDD diagnosis and other co-occurring conditions) associated with these outcomes. Results: Only 0.12% of adults with IDD who had no known HIV diagnosis had received an HIV test in the past year. The prevalence of HIV diagnosis among adults with IDD was 0.38%, although differences by type of IDD diagnosis were observed. Prevalence of HIV diagnosis differed by type of IDD. Among adults with IDD who were living with HIV, approximately 71% had received ART during 2012. The adjusted analyses indicate significant racial disparities, with Black adults with IDD making up the majority (59.11%) of the HIV-positive IDD adult population. Conclusions: Adults with IDD are a unique priority population at risk for HIV-related disparities, and the level of risk is differential among subtypes of IDD. People with IDD, like other people with disabilities, should be considered in prevention programming and treatment guidelines to address disparities across the HIV care continuum.",10.1111/jir.13099,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Methods: DHH participants in the United States responded to the Survey on Pregnancy Experiences of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Women. Respondents self-reported their antenatal depression diagnoses and drug use (i.e., pain relievers, cannabis, or illicit drugs) during their last pregnancy. Poisson regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and parity. Results: The average age of respondents (n = 587) was 35 years. Respondents were predominantly non-Hispanic white (80%), college educated (60%), and married (74%). Relative to DHH English-speakers, DHH ASL-users had lower prevalence of reporting antenatal depression diagnosis (aPR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.72). DHH people who reported antenatal depression diagnosis had higher prevalence of reporting antenatal drug use (PR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.65 to 3.33). There were no significant associations between preferred language and antenatal drug use. Conclusions: DHH ASL-users are less likely to report receiving an antenatal depression diagnosis compared to DHH English-speakers. Given well-documented patient-provider communication barriers among DHH ASL-users, it is unclear if the lower prevalence observed in this study is the result of inadequate or inaccessible screening during pregnancy. Future work should consider universal use of linguistically appropriate screening tools for DHH birthing parents in both clinical and research settings.",10.1007/s00737-024-01512-7,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Yet, unique health needs of people with disabilities (PWDs) are often underrecognized in public health practice. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) required the implementation of standardized data collection guidelines, including disability status, among federal agencies. The extent to which guidance from ACA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has impacted disability inclusion in CHNAs is unknown. This study used a content analysis approach to review CHNAs conducted by local health councils and the top 11 nonprofit hospitals in Florida (n = 77). We coded CHNAs based on mentioning disability in CHNA reports, involving disability-related stakeholders, and incorporating data on disability indicators. Findings indicate that PWDs are widely not included in CHNAs in Florida, emphasizing the need for equitable representation and comprehensive understanding of PWDs in community health planning.",10.1177/15248399231225642,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Despite legal mandates, identification and provision of necessary accommodations for this population at primary care clinics are poor. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess patient-reported disability status and accommodation needs among patients at a primary care clinic. Methods: An electronic health record–based Disability and Accommodations Questionnaire assessing disability status, types, and accommodation needs was developed by subject matter experts at Michigan Medicine and the University of Michigan Council for Disability Concerns. The questionnaire underwent multiple rounds of reviews and revisions before its use in clinical settings. A paper-based questionnaire was administered to all patients presenting for a wellness-based visit at an academic health system primary care clinic in southeast Michigan. Data were collected between March 2022 and August 2022. Results: Approximately 13% of the 541 patients self-reported a disability, with 54.2% indicating at least one needed accommodation. The most commonly reported disabilities were mental health and hearing-related disabilities, by 4.8% and 4.6% of patients, respectively. The most frequently requested accommodations were communication- or language-based (for example, presence of an American Sign Language interpreter, assistive listening devices), cognitive-based (for example, inclusion of a support person with care decisions), and mobility-based (for example, assistance with transfers). Conclusion: The Disability and Accommodations Questionnaire helped identify the presence of a disability, its types, and any requested accommodations requested at a primary care health center.",10.1016/j.jcjq.2023.10.012,,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,
Tyler G James,Emergency department patient-centred care perspectives from deaf and hard-of-hearing patients,2023.0,Health Expectations,Article,deaf and hard of hearing; emergency medicine; healthcare seeking; patient-centred care; patient–provider communication,"2023 The Authors. Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) patients are a priority population for emergency medicine health services research. DHH patients are at higher risk than non-DHH patients of using the emergency department (ED), have longer lengths of stay in the ED and report poor patient–provider communication. This qualitative study aimed to describe ED care-seeking and patient-centred care perspectives among DHH patients. Methods: This qualitative study is the second phase of a mixed-methods study. The goal of this study was to further explain quantitative findings related to ED outcomes among DHH and non-DHH patients. We conducted semistructured interviews with 4 DHH American Sign Language (ASL)-users and 6 DHH English speakers from North Central Florida. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a descriptive qualitative approach. Results: Two themes were developed: (1) DHH patients engage in a complex decision-making process to determine ED utilization and (2) patient-centred ED care differs between DHH ASL-users and DHH English speakers. The first theme describes the social-behavioural processes through which DHH patients assess their need to use the ED. The second theme focuses on the social environment within the ED: patients feeling stereotyped, involvement in the care process, pain communication, receipt of accommodations and discharge processes. Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of better understanding, and intervening in, DHH patient ED care-seeking and care delivery to improve patient outcomes. Like other studies, this study also finds that DHH patients are not a monolithic group and language status is an equity-relevant indicator. We also discuss recommendations for emergency medicine.

Child maltreatment prevention education programs are effective at improving safety of children and youth, generally. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand challenges, benefits, and important considerations of developing an IDD-tailored prevention program. Participants and setting: In total, we recruited 21 professionals and parents who have experience with a child with IDD from New York, Indiana, and Florida. Methods: Participants were segmented into three focus groups, which were conducted through web-based videoconferencing. Focus groups were moderated by experts in child maltreatment prevention and recorded for data collection. Recordings were transcribed and subsequently coded using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results: The analysis identified several challenges to implementing child maltreatment prevention to students with IDD and pedagogical strategies to overcome those, such as the use of visuals, standardized vocabulary, and relatable examples. Benefits of a prevention program were also mentioned, including feelings of empowerment that can be cultivated by providing opportunities where children with IDD practice being assertive. Considerations for program developers and staff were discussed to ensure that prevention programs are easily adaptable to suit the needs of students with IDD across the continuum. Conclusions: Previous research has indicated an unmet need for child maltreatment programs among children with IDD. Implementation of an IDD-tailored program must be preceded by gaining invaluable insight from professionals and parents.

All rights reserved.INTRODUCTION: The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), developed by the World Health Organization, is a classification framework that focuses on the health and functioning of people with disabilities. As part of an ICF Core Set development, four studies need to be conducted, one of which is a systematic review. This study presents part 1 of the systematic review that aims to describe the outcome measures identified in the literature related to functioning in individuals with deafblindness. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The research team screened articles from eight scientific databases, three journals, and Google Scholar (March 2011 to September 2022). Articles were included if they studied individuals with deafblindness aged 18 and older. Studies that examined genetics or laboratory experiments involving animals were excluded. Data were extracted into a logbook with key descriptors such as study location and design, age of study population, and instruments/outcome measures used, which were further categorized into one of the following types: 1) standardized; 2) patient-reported measures, standardized (PT-S); 3) patient-reported measures, not standardized (PT-not S); 4) health professional, reported measures, standardized (HP-S); 5) Technical measures; 6) other measures (parent-reported standardized and laboratory measures). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The review included 147 studies, of which most were conducted in Europe (47.6%) and North America (27.9%). Of the 314 identified outcome measures, 57 were Standardized, 59 were Patient Reported-Standardized (PT-S), 178 were patient reported non-standardized (PT-Not S) variables, 11 were health professional reported, standardized, five were technical, and four were classified as other measures. CONCLUSIONS: Most instruments measured functioning in daily activities and the mental health of individuals with deafblindness. Three deafblind-specific instruments were identified in this study, highlighting the need for more deafblind-specific instruments to be developed and utilized in research.",10.23736/S1973-9087.23.07890-5,University of Montreal,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Currently, few resources on advance care planning and end-of-life care exist in ASL. This study explores Deaf ASL users’ perceptions and experiences with end-of-life care and advance care planning. Methods: Semi-structured 1:1 interviews with Deaf signers were translated, and transcribed into English by a bilingual researcher. Investigators inductively coded transcripts and identified themes of barriers, facilitators, knowledge, and sources of information regarding end-of-life care. Participants’ knowledge of advance care planning and completion of advance care planning documents were evaluated using a brief assessment. Results: Eleven Deaf ASL users participated in the study with two deaf interviewers. Participants reported barriers to end-of-life care including poor provider communication, inaccessible sources, and inadequate provision of accommodations, leading to patient distrust. Participants’ understanding of advance care planning was facilitated by accessible forms of communication and their social networks, such as family, friends, and Deaf peers. Participants primarily gained information on end-of-life care from first-hand familial experience, peers, and media. Participants’ mean advance care planning knowledge was 4.6 out of 15 (SD = 2.6). Conclusions: Deaf ASL users face scarce accessible resources around end-of-life care, lowering their ability to understand and proceed with advance care planning.

Methods: An accessible web-based survey was administered to a non-probability sample of DHH people through national organizations, social media, and snowball sampling. Eligibility criteria included being 21 years or older; given birth in the U.S. within the past 10 years, report hearing loss prior to the most recent birth. Questions focused on healthcare experiences and information access during their last pregnancy. The sample included 583 respondents for the present analysis. We describe the communication accommodations requested and received during pregnancy, segmented by preferred language. Results: Most DHH participants reported communication with prenatal clinicians as “good” or “very good”. On-site interpreter services were most commonly requested by American Sign Language (ASL) only and bilingual DHH people. Interpersonal communication modification requests (e.g., speaking louder) were rarely obliged.

The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) is a shortened version of DASS-41 developed to measure these mental health conditions. The DASS-41 has strong evidence of validity and reliability in multiple contexts. However, the DASS-21, and the resulting item properties, has been explored less in terms of modern test theories. One such theory is Item Response Theory (IRT), and we use IRT models to explore latent item and person traits of each DASS-21 sub-scale among people living in Malaysia. Specifically, we aimed to assess Classical Test Theory and IRT properties including dimensionality, internal consistency (reliability), and item-level properties. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study and sent link-based questionnaires to people aged 18 and above in a private university and requested to roll out the link. Overall and individual sub-scales’ Cronbach’s alpha of the DASS-21 indicates an excellent internal consistency. The average inter-item correlation and corrected inter-item correlations for each of the sub-scales indicated acceptable discrimination. On average, DASS-21 total scores and sub-scale scores were significantly higher among female participants than males. The Graded Response Model had better empirical fit to sub-scale response data. Raw summated and latent (IRT estimated) scores of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress sub-scales, and overall DASS-21 were strongly correlated. Thus, this study provides evidence of validity supporting the use of the DASS-21 as a mental health screening tool among Malaysians.

Academic Emergency Medicine published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.Objective: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) patients are understudied in emergency medicine health services research. Theory and limited evidence suggest that DHH patients are at higher risk of emergency department (ED) utilization and poorer quality of care. This study assessed ED condition acuity, length of stay (LOS), and acute ED revisits among DHH patients. We hypothesized that DHH patients would experience poorer ED care outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of a single health care system using data from a large academic medical center in the southeast United States. Data were received from the medical center's data office, and we sampled patients and encounters from between June 2011 and April 2020. We compared DHH American Sign Language (ASL) users (n = 108), DHH English speakers (n = 358), and non-DHH English speakers (n = 302). We used multilevel modeling to assess the differences among patient segments in outcomes related to ED use and care. Results: As hypothesized, DHH ASL users had longer ED LOS than non-DHH English speakers, on average 30 min longer. Differences in ED condition acuity, measured through Emergency Severity Index and triage pain scale, were not statistically significant. DHH English speakers represented a majority (61%) of acute ED revisit encounters. Conclusions: Our study identified that DHH ASL users have longer ED LOS than non-DHH English speakers.

Methods: DHH participants in the United States responded to the Survey on Pregnancy Experiences of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Women. Respondents self-reported their antenatal depression diagnoses and drug use (i.e., pain relievers, cannabis, or illicit drugs) during their last pregnancy. Poisson regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and parity. Results: The average age of respondents (n = 587) was 35 years. Respondents were predominantly non-Hispanic white (80%), college educated (60%), and married (74%). Relative to DHH English-speakers, DHH ASL-users had lower prevalence of reporting antenatal depression diagnosis (aPR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.72). DHH people who reported antenatal depression diagnosis had higher prevalence of reporting antenatal drug use (PR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.65 to 3.33). There were no significant associations between preferred language and antenatal drug use. Conclusions: DHH ASL-users are less likely to report receiving an antenatal depression diagnosis compared to DHH English-speakers. Given well-documented patient-provider communication barriers among DHH ASL-users, it is unclear if the lower prevalence observed in this study is the result of inadequate or inaccessible screening during pregnancy. Future work should consider universal use of linguistically appropriate screening tools for DHH birthing parents in both clinical and research settings.",10.1007/s00737-024-01512-7,University of Michigan School of Public Health,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

James,Cesarean birth and adverse birth outcomes among sub-populations of deaf and hard-of-hearing people,2024.0,Disability and Health Journal,Article,Ear; Hearing; Communication; Deaf and hard-of-hearing; Obstetrics; Pregnancy,"2024 Elsevier Inc.Background: Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people are at higher risk than their non-DHH counterparts of experiencing adverse birth outcomes. There is a lack of research focusing on social, linguistic, and medical factors related to being DHH which may identify groups of DHH people who experience more inequity. Objective: Examine difference in prevalence of cesarean and adverse birth outcomes among diverse sub-groups of DHH people. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of DHH birthing people in the U.S. who gave birth within the past 10 years. The sample was predominantly white, college educated, and married. We assessed cesarean birth and three adverse birth outcomes: preterm birth, low birthweight, and NICU admission post-delivery. DHH-specific variables were genetic etiology of hearing loss, preferred language (i.e., American Sign Language, English, or bilingual), severity of hearing loss, age of onset of hearing loss, and self-reported quality of perinatal care communication. We estimated prevalence, 95 % confidence intervals, and unadjusted prevalence ratios. Results: Thirty-one percent of our sample reported a cesarean birth. Overall, there were no significant differences in prevalence across the outcome variables with respect to preferred language, genetic etiology, severity, and age of onset. Poorer perinatal care communication quality was associated with higher prevalence of preterm birth (PR = 2.37) and NICU admission (PR = 1.91). Conclusions: Our study found no evidence supporting differences in obstetric outcomes among DHH birthing people across medical factors related to deafness. Findings support the important role of communication access for DHH people in healthcare environments.",10.1016/j.dhjo.2024.101639,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

In this population, intersectional inequities lead to adverse health outcomes for both those individuals and the companion animals they care for. Community-based veterinary clinics provide an opportunity to target these inequities from a culturally sensitive lens, intending to improve human and animal outcomes. We conducted a process evaluation of a student-led community-based clinic for this population to better understand client satisfaction, assess learning outcomes among veterinary students, and improve program delivery and services. During academic year 2020–2021, the monthly clinics had 162 appointments in total with a median 15 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) candidates volunteering at each clinic. Clients and volunteers responded to survey questionnaires designed to elicit information about their experiences with the clinic, including open-ended questions for further elucidation of measurable indicators of client-, patient-, and student-level impact. Clients attributed enrollment in the clinic with improved quality-of-life and reduction of financial burden; the program saved clients approximately $2,050 per pet during the evaluation year. Furthermore, the clinic widely facilitated completion of the college’s core Primary Care and Dentistry learning outcomes. Beyond curriculum-standard learning objectives, students also reported positive attitude changes and increased readiness to provide care to people with disabilities and people experiencing low socioeconomic position. The results of this evaluation have significant implications for both veterinary and public health pedagogy. Especially, they highlight the significance of community health practice in veterinary trainee education.",10.3138/jvme-2023-0032,VCA Animal Hospitals,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

Journal of Intellectual Disability Research published by MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, HIV diagnosis and receipt of HIV care among adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) who are publicly insured in the USA. Design: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of Medicare–Medicaid linked data of adults with IDD who were publicly insured in 2012 (n = 878 186). Methods: We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios of HIV testing, diagnosis and receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We also identified the relationship between predisposing (age, gender, race and ethnicity), enabling (Medicare, Medicaid or both; rural status; geographical location; and county income) and need-related characteristics (IDD diagnosis and other co-occurring conditions) associated with these outcomes. Results: Only 0.12% of adults with IDD who had no known HIV diagnosis had received an HIV test in the past year. The prevalence of HIV diagnosis among adults with IDD was 0.38%, although differences by type of IDD diagnosis were observed. Prevalence of HIV diagnosis differed by type of IDD. Among adults with IDD who were living with HIV, approximately 71% had received ART during 2012. The adjusted analyses indicate significant racial disparities, with Black adults with IDD making up the majority (59.11%) of the HIV-positive IDD adult population. Conclusions: Adults with IDD are a unique priority population at risk for HIV-related disparities, and the level of risk is differential among subtypes of IDD. People with IDD, like other people with disabilities, should be considered in prevention programming and treatment guidelines to address disparities across the HIV care continuum.",10.1111/jir.13099,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,6117851.0

A tailored primary care approach for this vulnerable population that also accounts for social and functional risk factors could promote healthier aging and more equitable health care. Objective: This project will evaluate the implementation of a health program designed for people with physical disabilities. The proposed evaluation result is to generate the first best-practice protocol focused specifically on developing primary care to help reduce preventable causes of morbidity and improve functioning among people with physical disabilities. Methods: We will design and implement a pilot health program for people with physical disabilities at a primary care clinic within Michigan Medicine. The health program for people with physical disabilities will be an integrated intervention involving a tailored best practice alert designed to prompt family medicine providers to screen and monitor for common, preventable health conditions. The program will also collect social and functional status information to determine the patient’s need for further care coordination and support. Adult participants from this clinic with identified physical disabilities will be targeted for potential enrollment. To create a quasi-experimental setting, a separate departmental clinic will serve as a control site for comparison purposes. A quantitative analysis to estimate the treatment effect of implementing this health program will be conducted using a difference-in-differences approach. Outcomes of interest will include the use of preventative services (eg, hemoglobin A1c for diabetes screening), social work assistance, and emergency and hospital services. These data will be extracted from electronic health records. Time-invariant covariates, particularly sociodemographic covariates, will be included in the models. A qualitative analysis of patient and health care provider interviews will also be completed to assess the effect of the health program. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scores will be assessed to both screen for depression and anxiety as well as explore program impacts related to addressing health and functioning needs related to physical disabilities in a primary care setting. These will be summarized through descriptive analyses. Results: This study was funded in September 2018, data collection started in September 2021, and data collection is expected to be concluded in September 2023. Conclusions: This study is a mixed methods evaluation of the effectiveness of an integrated health program designed for people with physical disabilities, based on a quasi-experimental comparison between an intervention and a control clinic site. The intervention will be considered successful if it leads to improvements in greater use of screening and monitoring for preventable health conditions, increased social worker referrals to assist with health and functioning needs, and improvements in emergency and hospital-based services. The findings will help inform best practices for people with physical disabilities in a primary care setting.",10.2196/50105,University of Michigan Medical School,0009-0002-5189-3411,57194255959.0,2008544068.0

Child maltreatment prevention education programs are effective at improving safety of children and youth, generally. Objective: The goal of this study was to understand challenges, benefits, and important considerations of developing an IDD-tailored prevention program. Participants and setting: In total, we recruited 21 professionals and parents who have experience with a child with IDD from New York, Indiana, and Florida. Methods: Participants were segmented into three focus groups, which were conducted through web-based videoconferencing. Focus groups were moderated by experts in child maltreatment prevention and recorded for data collection. Recordings were transcribed and subsequently coded using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results: The analysis identified several challenges to implementing child maltreatment prevention to students with IDD and pedagogical strategies to overcome those, such as the use of visuals, standardized vocabulary, and relatable examples. Benefits of a prevention program were also mentioned, including feelings of empowerment that can be cultivated by providing opportunities where children with IDD practice being assertive. Considerations for program developers and staff were discussed to ensure that prevention programs are easily adaptable to suit the needs of students with IDD across the continuum. Conclusions: Previous research has indicated an unmet need for child maltreatment programs among children with IDD. Implementation of an IDD-tailored program must be preceded by gaining invaluable insight from professionals and parents.

The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) is a shortened version of DASS-41 developed to measure these mental health conditions. The DASS-41 has strong evidence of validity and reliability in multiple contexts. However, the DASS-21, and the resulting item properties, has been explored less in terms of modern test theories. One such theory is Item Response Theory (IRT), and we use IRT models to explore latent item and person traits of each DASS-21 sub-scale among people living in Malaysia. Specifically, we aimed to assess Classical Test Theory and IRT properties including dimensionality, internal consistency (reliability), and item-level properties. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study and sent link-based questionnaires to people aged 18 and above in a private university and requested to roll out the link. Overall and individual sub-scales’ Cronbach’s alpha of the DASS-21 indicates an excellent internal consistency. The average inter-item correlation and corrected inter-item correlations for each of the sub-scales indicated acceptable discrimination. On average, DASS-21 total scores and sub-scale scores were significantly higher among female participants than males. The Graded Response Model had better empirical fit to sub-scale response data. Raw summated and latent (IRT estimated) scores of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress sub-scales, and overall DASS-21 were strongly correlated. Thus, this study provides evidence of validity supporting the use of the DASS-21 as a mental health screening tool among Malaysians. Specifically, standard error of measurement was minimized to provide robust evidence of potential utility in identifying participants who are and are not experiencing these mental health issues.

Tyler G. James,Reframing Our Health Care System for Patients With Hearing Loss,2022.0,"Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research",Review,Ear; Hearing; Ear; Hearing,"2022 The Authors.Purpose: Nearly 20% of U.S. Americans report a hearing loss, yet our current health care system is poorly designed and equipped to effectively care for these individuals. Individuals with hearing loss report communication breakdowns, inaccessible health information, reduced awareness and training by health care providers, and decreased satisfaction while struggling with inadequate health lit-eracy. These all contribute to health inequities and increased health care expen-ditures and inefficiencies. It is time to reframe the health care system for these individuals using existing models of best practices and accessibility to mitigate inequities and improve quality of care. Method: A review of system-, clinic-, provider-, and patient-level barriers, along with existing and suggested efforts to improve care for individuals with hearing loss, are presented. Results: These strategies include improving screening and identification of hearing loss, adopting universal design and inclusion principles, implementing effective communication approaches, leveraging assistive technologies and training, and diversifying a team to better care for patients with hearing loss. Patients should also be encouraged to seek social support and resources from hearing loss organizations while leveraging technologies to help facilitate communication. Conclusions: The strategies described introduce actionable steps that can be made at the system, clinic, provider, and patient levels. With implementation of these steps, significant progress can be made to more proactively meet the needs of patients with hearing loss.

Despite legal mandates, identification and provision of necessary accommodations for this population at primary care clinics are poor. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess patient-reported disability status and accommodation needs among patients at a primary care clinic. Methods: An electronic health record–based Disability and Accommodations Questionnaire assessing disability status, types, and accommodation needs was developed by subject matter experts at Michigan Medicine and the University of Michigan Council for Disability Concerns. The questionnaire underwent multiple rounds of reviews and revisions before its use in clinical settings. A paper-based questionnaire was administered to all patients presenting for a wellness-based visit at an academic health system primary care clinic in southeast Michigan. Data were collected between March 2022 and August 2022. Results: Approximately 13% of the 541 patients self-reported a disability, with 54.2% indicating at least one needed accommodation. The most commonly reported disabilities were mental health and hearing-related disabilities, by 4.8% and 4.6% of patients, respectively. The most frequently requested accommodations were communication- or language-based (for example, presence of an American Sign Language interpreter, assistive listening devices), cognitive-based (for example, inclusion of a support person with care decisions), and mobility-based (for example, assistance with transfers). Conclusion: The Disability and Accommodations Questionnaire helped identify the presence of a disability, its types, and any requested accommodations requested at a primary care health center.",10.1016/j.jcjq.2023.10.012,,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) to examine human health and functioning. To use the ICF in clinical practice, smaller categories of ICF codes, referred to as Core Sets, were developed for specific health conditions. However, no ICF Core Set exists for deafblindness. As part of an ICF Core Set development, this paper examines the existing literature from an ICF perspective and links relevant data to the ICF categories. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Articles were selected from eight scientific databases, three journals, and Google Scholar. The research team linked outcome measures and qualitative studies to ICF codes using ICF linking rules. For each measure/qualitative study’s final code list, they included each code only once after eliminating any duplicates. Subsequently, a frequency analysis was conducted, and ICF categories identified in at least five studies were included in the candidate categories list. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 147 articles met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were from Europe (N.=70) and North America (N.=41). 316 categories were identified in at least five studies that belong to one of four ICF components. This includes 112 categories in the body function component, 3 categories in body structure, 163 in activities and participation, and 38 in environmental factors. Additionally, 21 personal factors relating to demographics were identified. The most frequent category was listening (category d115) at 82.31%, followed by range of emotions (category b1522) at 78.91%, hearing function (category b230) at 68.03%, and assistive products and technology for communication (category e1251) at 63.27%. CONCLUSIONS: As the second part of the first four studies in developing ICF Core Sets for deafblindness, this review described the ICF categories relevant to the functioning of individuals with deafblindness. These categories inform the development of the Core Sets on deafblindness from the researcher’s perspective. The final Core Sets will guide clinical practice, programs, and policies for individuals with deafblindness.",10.23736/S1973-9087.24.07984-X,University of Montreal,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

As part of an ICF Core Set development, four studies need to be conducted, one of which is a systematic review. This study presents part 1 of the systematic review that aims to describe the outcome measures identified in the literature related to functioning in individuals with deafblindness. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The research team screened articles from eight scientific databases, three journals, and Google Scholar (March 2011 to September 2022). Articles were included if they studied individuals with deafblindness aged 18 and older. Studies that examined genetics or laboratory experiments involving animals were excluded. Data were extracted into a logbook with key descriptors such as study location and design, age of study population, and instruments/outcome measures used, which were further categorized into one of the following types: 1) standardized; 2) patient-reported measures, standardized (PT-S); 3) patient-reported measures, not standardized (PT-not S); 4) health professional, reported measures, standardized (HP-S); 5) Technical measures; 6) other measures (parent-reported standardized and laboratory measures). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The review included 147 studies, of which most were conducted in Europe (47.6%) and North America (27.9%). Of the 314 identified outcome measures, 57 were Standardized, 59 were Patient Reported-Standardized (PT-S), 178 were patient reported non-standardized (PT-Not S) variables, 11 were health professional reported, standardized, five were technical, and four were classified as other measures. CONCLUSIONS: Most instruments measured functioning in daily activities and the mental health of individuals with deafblindness. Three deafblind-specific instruments were identified in this study, highlighting the need for more deafblind-specific instruments to be developed and utilized in research.",10.23736/S1973-9087.23.07890-5,University of Montreal,0000-0002-0694-4702,57201255863.0,

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The first all-virtual residency application cycle took place in 2021. Virtual programming can reduce cost, time, and travel burden; these may be especially beneficial to applicants with fewer resources and those from underrepresented backgrounds (URM). Little is known about how applicants evaluate key ranking factors, especially in a virtual format. This study aimed to assess how applicants evaluated programs in the virtual cycle. METHODS: We surveyed 271 fourth-year students at three Chicago medical schools after rank-list submission and prior to receiving match results in March 2021. The survey included questions on online content and importance of different ranking factors as well as open-ended questions on how participants evaluated their most important factors. We analyzed quantitative data using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests. We analyzed qualitative data using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Applicants cited goodness of fit, geographic location, program rep-utation, fellowship opportunities, and work/life balance as the top-five most important factors. URM applicants were more likely to prioritize diversity at institution or location (P<.0001). Interactions with residents and faculty and opportunities to observe interprogram dynamics were key to assessing fit but were often limited by the virtual format. Additional emergent themes provided recommendations for future cycles. Program websites and videos were rated as the most important online content types. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information about how applicants evaluated the factors they deemed most important in assessing and ranking pro-grams, which can help residency programs improve their recruitment efforts.",10.22454/fammed.2022.148473,The University of Chicago,,57843994400.0,

All rights reserved.Background: This study describes medical malpractice claims from a large academic family medicine department over 20 years. The intent of this investigation is to analyze trends within the department, seeking to better understand how to improve the quality of patient care. Study Design: The Office of Patient Relations and Clinical Risk (PRCR) at University of Michigan Health maintains a centralized database of family medicine malpractice claims dating back to 1987. Records from 2000 to 2020 were requested from this database and received in a deidentified manner to protect patient confidentiality, and as such this study was exempt from IRB review. A total of 55 claims occurred during this time period. These claims were then analyzed in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Results: Of the 55 claims, 87.3% involved adult patients; 76.5% of the claims occurred in the outpatient setting; 98.1% of the claims involved attending physicians and 26.9% involved resident physicians; 54.5% of the claims were closed without payment and 43.6% of the claims were settled. The average settled claim amount was $742,110.50 which dropped to $160,838.59 after excluding obstetric claims. In addition, 61.8% of the claims were related to diagnosis related allegations and 16.4% of the claims involved treatment related allegations. Primarily involving allegations of missed or delayed diagnoses of cancer, 29.1% of the claims were cancer related. While 79.2% of settled claims did not meet standard of care, 83.3% of the claims closed without payment did meet standard of care. Conclusions: Most claims involved adult patients, occurred in the outpatient setting, and involved diagnosis related allegations. Although representing a minority of the claims, obstetric claims made up most of the total settlement amount. Missed or delayed diagnoses of cancer were a common cause for claims, reinforcing the important role that primary care physicians have in supervising and administering preventative health care to patients.

For patients who have heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, randomized clinical trials demonstrate consistent mortality benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct-acting vasodilators, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Additionally, some data show benefits from two new classes of drugs: angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor and sinus node modulator. Diuretics and digoxin can be used as needed for symptom control. Statins are not recommended solely for treatment of heart failure. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and biventricular pacemakers improve mortality and function in selected patients.

William E Chavey,The status of adult inpatient care by family physicians at US academic medical centers and affiliated teaching hospitals 2003 to 2012: The impact of the hospitalist movement,2014.0,Family Medicine,Article,"hospitalists versus, inpatient, hospital performance, adult inpatient, inpatient discharges, hospitalist movement, inpatient care, hospitalists difference, family physicians","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Over the past 10-15 years, the number of hospitalists has grown from a few hundred to over 30,000, and hospitalists have assumed a greater proportion of the care of hospitalized patients. No existing studies report on the impact this movement has had on the characteristics of the hospital practice of family physicians in teaching hospitals. To explore this impact we examined the volume and scope of discharges by family physicians at teaching hospitals in 2003 and 2012, the most recent decade of hospitalist growth. We also compared the characteristics of family physicians' hospital practices in 2012 with hospitalists in 2012 to assess for differences in hospital performance. METHODS: We used the University Health Consortium (UHC) Clinical Database to capture adult non-pregnancy-related inpatient discharges in US teaching hospitals by family physicians and hos- pitalists in 2003 and 2012. We calculated the proportion of inpatient discharges by specialty in all UCH hospitals; did a qualitative comparison of frequent discharge diagnoses; and analyzed length of stay, case mix index, 7- and 30-day readmission rates, and mortality by specialty using UHCs risk adjustment methodology. RESULTS: The proportion of all inpatient discharges by family physicians in UHC hospitals was stable between 2003 and 2012 (2.7% versus 2.6%) though the volume increased. Over the same time, the proportion of discharges attributable to hospitalists increased (0.0% to 13.9%) with a concomitant decrease in proportion of discharges from general medicine (18.4% to 13.9%) and all other specialties (78.9% to 73.2%). Fourteen of the top 20 discharge diagnoses by family physicians from UHC hospitals were the same between 2003 and 2012. Family physicians and hospitalists shared 17 of the top 20 discharge diagnoses in 2012. Length of hospital stay was stable for family medicine across time and lower than that of hospitalists (4.5 versus 5.5 days; P<.001). Seven- and 30-day readmission rates for any cause were lower for hospitalists but there was no difference in either rate when limited to readmission for the same DRG. Hospitalists cared for a somewhat more complex patient mix. CONCLUSIONS: The growth of hospitalists has had little to no impact on the proportion of inpatient discharges in teaching hospitals by family physicians. Quality of care as judged by length of stay, mortality, and readmission rates was comparable between family physicians and hospitals in 2012.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0003-0324-9381,6602234157.0,

Mortality rates are high, yet a number of pharmacologic interventions may improve outcomes. Other interventions, including patient education, counseling, and regular self-monitoring, are critical, but are beyond the scope of this article. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers reduce mortality and should be administered to all patients unless contraindicated. Diuretics are indicated for symptomatic patients as needed for volume overload. Aldosterone antagonists and direct-acting vasodilators, such as isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine, may improve mortality in selected patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as an alternative therapy for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and in some patients who are persistently symptomatic. Digoxin may improve symptoms and is helpful for persons with concomitant atrial fibrillation, but it does not reduce cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Serum digoxin levels should not exceed 1.0 ng per mL (1.3 nmol per L), especially in women.

Because of the public's concern regarding the possibility of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from health care worker to patient, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening health care workers for HIV. Methods. The study examined a screening protocol that would include a sequence of antibody tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the Western blot) and culture for HIV. The incremental cost-effectiveness of applying this protocol as opposed to the status quo for the prevention of transmission of HIV from health care worker to patient was evaluated. Sensitivity analysis was performed on appropriate variables. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was then compared with that of other interventions. Results. The expected annual cost of screening to a large hospital was found to be $244,382 to prevent 0.02663 transmissions. The incremental cost- effectiveness ratio was $9,177,615 per transmission prevented. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is relatively insensitive to the variability in the performance characteristics of the individual tests but highly sensitive to variance in HIV prevalence, estimated risk of transmission, and the number of exposure-prone procedures performed annually. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $917,762 to $91,776,156 per transmission prevented. Conclusions. Screening health care workers for prevention of potential HIV transmission to patients is an expensive use of health care resources.",,John Sealy School of Medicine,0000-0003-0324-9381,6602234157.0,

Chavey,Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening health care workers for HIV,1994.0,Journal of Family Practice,Article,"cost effectiveness, hiv methods, hiv incremental, cost screening, hiv, screening, screening health, workers hiv, patients expensive","Background. Because of the public's concern regarding the possibility of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from health care worker to patient, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening health care workers for HIV. Methods. The study examined a screening protocol that would include a sequence of antibody tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the Western blot) and culture for HIV. The incremental cost-effectiveness of applying this protocol as opposed to the status quo for the prevention of transmission of HIV from health care worker to patient was evaluated. Sensitivity analysis was performed on appropriate variables. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was then compared with that of other interventions. Results. The expected annual cost of screening to a large hospital was found to be $244,382 to prevent 0.02663 transmissions. The incremental cost- effectiveness ratio was $9,177,615 per transmission prevented. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is relatively insensitive to the variability in the performance characteristics of the individual tests but highly sensitive to variance in HIV prevalence, estimated risk of transmission, and the number of exposure-prone procedures performed annually. Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $917,762 to $91,776,156 per transmission prevented. Conclusions. Screening health care workers for prevention of potential HIV transmission to patients is an expensive use of health care resources.",,John Sealy School of Medicine,0000-0003-0324-9381,6602234157.0,

Part II of this two-part article presents treatment recommendations for patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The authors recommend that, if tolerated and not contraindicated, the following agents be used in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in all patients; A beta blocker in all patients except those who have symptoms at rest; and spironolactone in patients who have symptoms at rest or who have had such symptoms within the past six months.

Patients also experience dependent swelling and fatigue. Measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) identifies HF patients who may respond to pharmacologic therapy and/or electrophysiologic device implantation. Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors can significantly lower the mortality and morbidity of HF in patients with an LVEF less than 35%. Cardiac defibrillators and biventricular pacemakers can also improve outcomes in selected patients with a decreased LVEF.

For patients who have heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, randomized clinical trials demonstrate consistent mortality benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct-acting vasodilators, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Additionally, some data show benefits from two new classes of drugs: angiotensin receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor and sinus node modulator. Diuretics and digoxin can be used as needed for symptom control. Statins are not recommended solely for treatment of heart failure. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and biventricular pacemakers improve mortality and function in selected patients. For patients who have been hospitalized for heart failure, disease management programs and telemonitoring can reduce hospitalizations and mortality.",,Michigan Medicine,0000-0003-0324-9381,6602234157.0,

Mortality rates are high, yet a number of pharmacologic interventions may improve outcomes. Other interventions, including patient education, counseling, and regular self-monitoring, are critical, but are beyond the scope of this article. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers reduce mortality and should be administered to all patients unless contraindicated. Diuretics are indicated for symptomatic patients as needed for volume overload. Aldosterone antagonists and direct-acting vasodilators, such as isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine, may improve mortality in selected patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers can be used as an alternative therapy for patients intolerant of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and in some patients who are persistently symptomatic. Digoxin may improve symptoms and is helpful for persons with concomitant atrial fibrillation, but it does not reduce cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Serum digoxin levels should not exceed 1.0 ng per mL (1.3 nmol per L), especially in women.

Traditionally, beta blockers have been considered to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure. Recently, however, several large randomized, controlled mortality trials have been stopped early because of significant improvement in mortality rates in patients with heart failure who were given beta blockers in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and, sometimes, digoxin. Beta blockers should now be considered standard, therapy in patients with New York Heart Association class II or class III heart failure who are hemodynamically stable, who do not have dyspnea at rest and who have no other contraindications to the use of these agents.",,University of Michigan Medical School,0000-0003-0324-9381,6602234157.0,
William E. Chavey,The status of adult inpatient care by family physicians at US academic medical centers and affiliated teaching hospitals 2003 to 2012: The impact of the hospitalist movement,2014.0,Family Medicine,Article,"hospitalists versus, inpatient, hospital performance, adult inpatient, inpatient discharges, hospitalist movement, inpatient care, hospitalists difference, family physicians","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Over the past 10-15 years, the number of hospitalists has grown from a few hundred to over 30,000, and hospitalists have assumed a greater proportion of the care of hospitalized patients. No existing studies report on the impact this movement has had on the characteristics of the hospital practice of family physicians in teaching hospitals. To explore this impact we examined the volume and scope of discharges by family physicians at teaching hospitals in 2003 and 2012, the most recent decade of hospitalist growth. We also compared the characteristics of family physicians' hospital practices in 2012 with hospitalists in 2012 to assess for differences in hospital performance. METHODS: We used the University Health Consortium (UHC) Clinical Database to capture adult non-pregnancy-related inpatient discharges in US teaching hospitals by family physicians and hos- pitalists in 2003 and 2012. We calculated the proportion of inpatient discharges by specialty in all UCH hospitals; did a qualitative comparison of frequent discharge diagnoses; and analyzed length of stay, case mix index, 7- and 30-day readmission rates, and mortality by specialty using UHCs risk adjustment methodology. RESULTS: The proportion of all inpatient discharges by family physicians in UHC hospitals was stable between 2003 and 2012 (2.7% versus 2.6%) though the volume increased. Over the same time, the proportion of discharges attributable to hospitalists increased (0.0% to 13.9%) with a concomitant decrease in proportion of discharges from general medicine (18.4% to 13.9%) and all other specialties (78.9% to 73.2%). Fourteen of the top 20 discharge diagnoses by family physicians from UHC hospitals were the same between 2003 and 2012. Family physicians and hospitalists shared 17 of the top 20 discharge diagnoses in 2012. Length of hospital stay was stable for family medicine across time and lower than that of hospitalists (4.5 versus 5.5 days; P<.001). Seven- and 30-day readmission rates for any cause were lower for hospitalists but there was no difference in either rate when limited to readmission for the same DRG. Hospitalists cared for a somewhat more complex patient mix. CONCLUSIONS: The growth of hospitalists has had little to no impact on the proportion of inpatient discharges in teaching hospitals by family physicians. Quality of care as judged by length of stay, mortality, and readmission rates was comparable between family physicians and hospitals in 2012.",,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor",0000-0003-0324-9381,6602234157.0,
