# Faculty Scholarly Work Database: A Tool for Equitable Professional Advancement

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to provide the Michigan Medicine Department of Family Medicine with two major deliverables:
- a comprehensive dataset of faculty publications sourced from the following online databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ORCID, 
- a Tableau dashboard designed to provide the department with actionable insights for identifying promotion opportunities and fostering collaborative initiatives among physicians and clinicians for future projects.   

This project was completed by Sydney Lauer, Aren Shah, Ariane Stenstedt, and Jing He. This project was completed for the University of Michigan’s School of Information’s Information Analysis capstone: SI 485 nformation Analysis Capstone II. 

## Contents
This github repository is organized as follows: 
- **Final Files** - Contains the final versions of the two files used as the data source for the Tableau Workbook:
  - **final_dataset.csv**
  - **keywords.xlsx**
- **Archived CSV Files** - Contains past versions of the combined dataset, the individual publication datasets for each original database that data was pulled from, and csv files from early iterations of our NLP program designed to generate keywords.  
- **Python Files** - Contains all the .ipynb files with all of the code generated for this project. 
- A copy of the final Tableau Workbook deliverable (**Dashboard.twb**)
- A video walkthrough designed to help the Family Medicine team replicate the Tableau workbook and update as needed (**whatever the name of the video is**).
